# Chapter 32: The Super AI Orchestra - Managing 7-9 AI Agents

Imagine orchestrating 7-9 AI Agents simultaneously, each building features in parallel while you focus on strategy and creative decisions. No coordination meetings. No synchronization chaos. No endless context-switching between team members. Just clear specifications that define how work gets done, autonomous agents executing independently, and integration that happens cleanly because decomposition was done right.

This chapter teaches you exactly how to make that vision real. You'll start by learning to manage 2-3 agents manually (building decomposition thinking), then understand scaling thresholds (what works at 3, what breaks at 5, what's required for more than 5), learn contract-based autonomous coordination, and finally experience SpecKit-orchestrated execution where SpecKit Plus itself coordinates 5-10 agents while you focus on strategy. Welcome to creative independence.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this chapter, you'll master the foundational skills that enable you to orchestrate autonomous agents (AI or human):

- **Decomposition Thinking** — How to break complex systems into parallelizable units with clear integration contracts (the bottleneck that enables 7-9 agent coordination)
- **Manual Parallel Workflows** — Coordinate 2-3 AI agents across git worktrees, running `/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, `/sp.implement` simultaneously (experiencing 2.5-3x speedup)
- **Sandboxing** — Isolate multi-session work safely using OS-level session isolation
- **Scaling Analysis** — Understanding what works at 3 agents, what breaks at 5 agents, and what's required for 7-9 agents
- **Integration Contracts** — Define explicit contracts (contract.md) that enable autonomous agent coordination without constant supervision
- **SpecKit Orchestration** — Use SpecKit Plus itself as orchestrator to coordinate 5-10 agents through contracts, hooks, and completion notification
- **Integration Quality** — Validate decomposition through clean merges (or learn from merge conflicts)
- **Portfolio-Worthy Projects** — Deliver real, measurable 3-5 feature systems that demonstrate strategic thinking

Most importantly, you'll build the muscle memory for decomposition thinking that's transferable to managing human teams, distributed organizations, and scaling beyond yourself.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have completed:

- **Chapter 30**: Understanding Specification-Driven Development (philosophy and motivation)
- **Chapter 31**: SpecKit Plus Hands-On (practical workflow experience with `/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, `/sp.implement`)
- **Chapter 8**: Git & GitHub (understanding branching, merging, conflict resolution)
- **Chapter 7**: Bash Essentials (terminal proficiency and command-line comfort)
- **Chapter 5**: Claude Code CLI (basic features and setup)

These prerequisites ensure you understand the tools and workflows that Lesson 1 builds upon.

This chapter emphasizes decomposition thinking (60%) over tool proficiency (40%). The thinking is evergreen; tools change. By mastering decomposition, you'll be able to coordinate AI agents, human teams, distributed organizations. The decomposition patterns you learn work for AI agents today and human teams tomorrow. The thinking scales across all complexity.
