# The AI Agent Factory

> The Spec-Driven Blueprint for Building and Monetizing Digital FTEs (Full-Time Equivalent Reliable AI Agents). 86 chapters across 9 parts. Published February 2026 by Panaversity.

The AI Agent Factory teaches domain experts how to build sellable AI agents using Claude Code, MCP, and agent SDKs. It covers the full journey from understanding AI agents to building, deploying, and monetizing them at scale. The book is grounded in the February 2026 "SaaSpocalypse" — nearly $1 trillion erased from software stocks when Anthropic's Claude Cowork proved autonomous agents can perform complex professional work that justified $200/month SaaS subscriptions.

Core thesis: In the AI era, the most valuable companies won't sell software — they'll manufacture AI employees. The SaaS era sold subscriptions; the Agent Factory era sells results. Buyers define intent. Agents execute. Humans supervise and verify.

Key concepts: Digital FTE (AI employee working 168 hours/week under human supervision), Spec-Driven Development (specs as source of truth, AI generates code from specs), Agent Skills (reusable intelligence in SKILL.md format), MCP (Model Context Protocol — universal tool connectivity standard), The Agent Triangle (General Agents vs Custom-Built vs Pre-Built AI Employees).

Pedagogical approach: YAML frontmatter with Bloom's taxonomy objectives, CEFR A1-C2 skill scaffolding, interactive "Try With AI" prompts, 4-layer teaching method (Manual Foundation → AI Collaboration → Intelligence Building → Spec-Driven Capstones).
