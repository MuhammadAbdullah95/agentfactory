# Chapter 12: Meet Your First AI Employee (OpenClaw)

In January 2026, OpenClaw went viral—165,000 GitHub stars, the fastest-growing repository in history. It proved something profound: **AI Employees are real, they work, and people want them.**

This chapter gives you that experience. You will set up a working AI Employee on Telegram, do real work with it, then understand how it works under the hood. You will learn to build **portable skills**, connect real services, and deploy for 24/7 operation.
