# Summary: Chapter Assessment & What Comes Next

## Key Takeaways
1. An AI Employee is an autonomous system built on 6 universal patterns, not just a smarter chatbot.
2. Every pattern you observed in OpenClaw maps directly to what you build with Claude Code in Chapter 13.
3. The implementation details change entirely between frameworks -- the patterns are identical.
4. Specification-driven design (define what you need before building) is the foundation of Chapter 13.
5. Score 8/12 or higher before proceeding; gaps in pattern understanding compound in Chapter 13.

## Chapter 12 to Chapter 13 Bridge
| Pattern | Ch 12 (OpenClaw) | Ch 13 (Claude Code) |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration | Gateway daemon | Claude Code CLI |
| I/O Adapters | Telegram channel | MCP servers |
| State Isolation | Sessions (JSONL) | Conversation context |
| Capability Packaging | SKILL.md in workspace | SKILL.md in .claude/skills/ |
| Externalized Memory | MEMORY.md + daily logs | CLAUDE.md + Obsidian vault |
| Autonomous Invocation | Cron + Heartbeat | Cron + git hooks |

## Scoring Guide
- **10-12**: Proceed with confidence.
- **8-9**: Review missed questions, then proceed.
- **6-7**: Re-read Lessons 4, 6, 7 first.
- **Below 6**: Redo hands-on work (L2-3) and re-read L4-7.
