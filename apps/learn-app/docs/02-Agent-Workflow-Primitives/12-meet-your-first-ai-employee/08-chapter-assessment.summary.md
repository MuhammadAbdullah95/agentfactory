# Summary: Chapter Assessment & What Comes Next

## Key Takeaways

1. An AI Employee is an autonomous system built on 6 universal patterns, not just a smarter chatbot.
2. The implementation details change entirely between frameworks -- the patterns are identical.
3. Specification-driven design (define what you need before building) is the foundation of Chapter 13.
4. Score 8/12 or higher before proceeding; gaps in pattern understanding compound in Chapter 13.

## Chapter 12 to Chapter 13 Bridge

The same 6 patterns from L04 and L06 map directly: OpenClaw's Gateway becomes Claude Code's CLI, Telegram channels become MCP servers, JSONL sessions become conversation context, workspace SKILL.md becomes `.claude/skills/`, MEMORY.md + daily logs become CLAUDE.md + Obsidian vault, and Cron + Heartbeat become Cron + git hooks. See L06 for the full cross-framework comparison across 4 frameworks.

## Scoring Guide

- **10-12**: Proceed with confidence.
- **8-9**: Review missed questions, then proceed.
- **6-7**: Re-read Lessons 4, 6, 7 first.
- **Below 6**: Redo hands-on work (L2-3) and re-read L4-7.
