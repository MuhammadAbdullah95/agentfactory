### Core Concept
The chapter assessment validates both understanding (15-question quiz covering concepts, technical details, and application) and capability (portfolio demonstrating working AI Employee). Understanding without building is theory; building without understanding is fragile. Together they prove production readiness.

### Key Mental Models
- **Bronze/Silver/Gold Tiers**: Graduated portfolio requirements — Bronze proves foundational skills, Silver adds proactive features, Gold demonstrates production deployment
- **Verification Not Demonstration**: Screenshots and logs prove your setup works, not just that you followed instructions
- **Self-Assessment Loop**: Honest reflection on gaps drives targeted review before submission

### Critical Patterns
- Quiz structure: Section A (Concepts 1-5), Section B (Technical 6-10), Section C (Application 11-15)
- Passing threshold: 70% (11/15) demonstrates solid understanding
- Bronze requirements: Working skill (any domain) + README documenting capabilities + screenshot
- Portfolio structure: `skills/`, `config/`, `docs/`, `screenshots/` directories
- Security hygiene: Never commit `.env`, tokens, or personal data — use `.example` files with placeholders

### Common Mistakes
- Skipping quiz review for incorrect answers (use AI to understand why correct answer is right)
- Committing real credentials in config examples
- Missing setup guide that others could follow
- Treating Bronze as "done" instead of foundation for Silver/Gold
- Not testing portability by trying skills on different platform (Claude Code)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: All 9 previous lessons culminating in working AI Employee with skills, services, and deployment
- **Leads to**: Advanced chapters (coding, research, writing workflows), custom domain adaptation
