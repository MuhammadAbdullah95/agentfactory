This lesson provides 10 hands-on exercises across 4 modules (3 skill modules + 1 capstone module) that build proficiency in multi-agent orchestration from single-agent to coordinated team workflows. Three core skills thread through every exercise: **team orchestration** (creating teams, spawning teammates, navigating structure), **task coordination** (dependencies, ownership, pipelines), and **hook design** (quality gates, event-driven automation). The **Team Orchestration Workflow** guides students through a 6-step cycle: Design, Create, Coordinate, Communicate, Monitor, Validate.

Modules progress from foundational team management to sophisticated quality enforcement: Team Fundamentals, Task Coordination, Quality Hooks, and Integration Capstones. Each of the first three modules contains a hands-on exercise (with starter and better prompts) and a debug exercise (diagnose what went wrong, no prompts provided). Module 4 offers two capstones: Full 3-Agent Parallel Code Review and Your Professional Domain, combining team creation, task dependencies, and hook-based quality gates into complete multi-agent workflows.

Students self-assess using a 4-criteria rubric (Team Creation, Task Coordination, Hook Design, Debug Skill) scored 1-4. After completing these exercises, students transition to Lesson 22 (Claude Cowork desktop interface). This lesson builds directly on Lesson 20 (Agent Teams foundations) and prepares students for professional-scale multi-agent coordination patterns.
