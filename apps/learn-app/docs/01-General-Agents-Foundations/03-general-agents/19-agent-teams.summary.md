Agent Teams lets you coordinate multiple Claude Code instances as a team. Unlike subagents (Lesson 11) which are fire-and-forget workers that report back to a single caller, Agent Teams creates fully independent Claude sessions that communicate directly with each other through a shared task list and inter-agent messaging. Each teammate has its own clean context window, preventing the context degradation that happens when one agent tries to do everything.

The key capabilities include: TeamCreate for spawning teammates with specific roles, a shared task list with dependency chains that teammates self-coordinate around, direct messages between any teammates (not just to the lead), delegate mode (Shift+Tab) that forces the lead to coordinate rather than implement, plan approval that requires teammates to get their approach reviewed before making changes, and quality hooks (TeammateIdle, TaskCompleted) that enforce standards automatically. Navigation uses Shift+Up/Down to switch between teammate views and Ctrl+T to monitor the task list.

Use Agent Teams when teammates need to talk to each other -- parallel code review from multiple angles, investigating a bug from competing hypotheses, or building a feature across independent layers (frontend, backend, tests). Use subagents when workers just need to report back -- focused single-file tasks, library research summaries, or quick fixes. The tradeoff is cost: teams use 3-5x more tokens because each teammate maintains a full context window, so the quality improvement from parallel focused analysis must justify the expense.
