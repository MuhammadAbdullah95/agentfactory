# Chapter 3: Working with General Agents: Claude Code and Cowork

You know _why_ AI-driven development matters—and that it's happening right now, in 2026. But understanding transformation and experiencing it are two different things.

This chapter introduces you to **Claude's General Agents**—Claude Code and Cowork. These aren't just AI assistants; they're **agentic AI systems** that can reason through problems, make plans, and take action across domains.

What's a General Agent? An AI that observes, orients, decides, and acts—the OODA loop—executing actions rather than just generating text. Claude Code uses the terminal interface (for developers), while Claude Cowork uses the desktop interface (for knowledge workers). Both are powered by the same Claude Agent SDK.

The goal is **not to build a supercomputer**, but to establish Claude as your **collaborative thinking partner** for everything—and to build Skills that can become products.

## 📚 Teaching Aid

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll have:

- **General Agents Explained** — Understanding why Claude's agentic AI is fundamentally different from passive assistants: the OODA reasoning loop, the Product Overhang insight, and filesystem access as the universal interface
- **Two Interfaces, One AI** — Claude Code (terminal-based for developers) and Cowork (desktop-based for knowledge workers), both running on the Claude Agent SDK
- **Claude Code Installed & Working** — Complete setup with **multiple paths**: Official Claude Pro/Max subscription (Lesson 2), OR free backends via OpenRouter, Gemini, or DeepSeek (Lesson 3)
- **Hello World** — Mastering the CLI interface (Lesson 4): slash commands, permission loops, and safe usage patterns
- **Persistent Project Context** — Creating CLAUDE.md files (Lesson 5) that eliminate repetitive context-sharing and establish team memory
- **Teach Claude Your Way** — Mastering custom instructions (Lesson 6) to align Claude's behavior with your personal or team standards
- **Autonomous Expertise** — Agent Skills (Lessons 7-8) with prompt patterns (Persona + Questions + Principles)
- **Practical Problem-Solving Exercises** — 27 hands-on exercises across 8 modules (Lesson 9) building problem decomposition, specification writing, and quality verification skills
- **Subagent Orchestration** — Recognizing when Claude automatically delegates to specialized agents (Lesson 10) for complex tasks
- **Agent Skills Exercises** — 27 hands-on exercises (Lesson 11) from skill anatomy to production-ready skill suites and capstone projects
- **External Integration** — MCP servers (Lesson 12) for safe access to external systems
- **Token Optimization** — Compiling MCP servers to Skills (Lesson 13) for 80-98% token reduction
- **Configuration Mastery** — Settings hierarchy (Lesson 14) and precedence rules for team collaboration
- **Event-Driven Automation** — Hooks (Lesson 15) for custom behaviors triggered by events
- **Complete Extensibility** — Discovering and using plugins (Lesson 16)
- **Autonomous Iteration** — The Ralph Wiggum Loop (Lesson 17) for self-correcting workflows
- **The Creator's Workflow** — How Boris Cherny (Lesson 18) uses Claude Code effectively
- **Claude Cowork Fundamentals** — From terminal to desktop (Lesson 19), getting started (Lesson 20), and practical workflows (Lesson 21)
- **Browser Integration** — Claude in Chrome (Lesson 22) for web-based automation
- **Connectors** — MCP for everyone (Lesson 23): pre-built integrations with Google Workspace, Notion, Slack, and more
- **Safety, Limitations & What's Coming** — Understanding boundaries, responsible use, and the future of agentic AI (Lesson 24)
- **Built-in Document Skills** — Working with docx, xlsx, pptx, and pdf files (Lesson 25)
- **Decision Framework** — Choosing between Code and Cowork (Lesson 26)
- **From Skills to Business** — Understanding how Skills become monetizable products (Lesson 27), the Digital FTE model, and the path to revenue
- **Chapter Quiz** — 50-question interactive assessment (Lesson 28) covering all chapter concepts
