# File Processing Workflows

Your Downloads folder has become chaos. You can't find that tax document from last year. Screenshots pile up with meaningless names. Sound familiar?

In this chapter, you'll solve these problems by directing Claude Code—not by memorizing bash commands. You'll describe what you want, watch the agent work, and learn to recognize the Seven Principles in action.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

| Skill                           | What It Looks Like                                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct file surveys             | "Help me understand what's eating my disk space"         |
| Request safety-first operations | "Back up important files before making changes"          |
| Design organization systems     | "Create categories that make sense for my workflow"      |
| Automate batch operations       | "Rename these 100 screenshots with a consistent pattern" |
| Search intelligently            | "Find that PDF from 2023 about taxes"                    |

This isn't about learning bash. It's about learning to work effectively with a General Agent.

## Chapter Flow

| Lesson                         | Time   | What You'll Do                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 1. Your First Agent Workflow   | 25 min | Survey your files through conversation  |
| 2. The Safety-First Pattern    | 20 min | Learn to require backups before changes |
| 3. The Organization Workflow   | 30 min | Design and execute file categorization  |
| 4. Batch Operations Workflow   | 30 min | Transform repetitive tasks into scripts |
| 5. Search & Discovery Workflow | 25 min | Find lost files through description     |
| 6. Capstone: Your File Toolkit | 30 min | Build your personal prompt library      |

**Total time**: Approximately 2.5-3 hours

## Seven Principles Observed

You won't memorize these principles—you'll see them in action:

| Principle                  | You'll Observe The Agent...                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| P1: Bash is the Key        | Using `ls`, `find`, `grep`, `mv` behind the scenes |
| P2: Code as Interface      | Creating reusable scripts for repetitive tasks     |
| P3: Verification           | Checking results after each operation              |
| P4: Decomposition          | Testing on one file before batch operations        |
| P5: Persisting State       | Saving rules and logs to files                     |
| P6: Constraints and Safety | Creating backups before destructive changes        |
| P7: Observability          | Logging everything and showing progress            |

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter:

- Complete Part 1 (Chapters 1-5)
- Have Claude Code installed and working
- Have a folder with files to organize (Downloads recommended)

## What You'll Build

By the end, you'll have:

| Deliverable        | Purpose                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Prompt toolkit     | Reusable prompts for common file tasks |
| Organization rules | Documented categorization logic        |
| Search patterns    | Templates for finding lost files       |
| Automation scripts | Agent-generated code you can reuse     |

## Connection to Chapter 11

The patterns you learn here become the foundation for Chapter 11 (AI Employee):

| This Chapter          | Chapter 11              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Manual prompting      | Automatic file watching |
| One-time organization | Continuous organization |
| "Show me the plan"    | AI decides and acts     |

You're building the vocabulary and verification instincts you'll need for autonomous agents.
