### Core Concept
The email-summarizer skill transforms your AI Employee from a writer into an analyst. It extracts actionable intelligence from email threads—key decisions, action items, open questions, and sentiment—saving you from re-reading long conversations.

### Key Mental Models
- **Intelligence vs Content**: Summarization extracts meaning, not just shorter text
- **Thread Context**: Understanding email chains requires tracking who said what and when
- **Actionable Output**: Good summaries lead directly to decisions ("3 action items for you")

### Critical Patterns
- Summary structure: Key Points, Action Items, Decisions Made, Open Questions
- Thread analysis: Track participants, identify requesters, note deadlines
- Sentiment detection: Flag frustration, urgency, or blockers in conversations
- Progressive detail: Provide overview first, details on request

### Common Mistakes
- Summarizing individual emails instead of full threads
- Missing implicit action items (requests phrased as questions)
- Not distinguishing between FYI and action-required content
- Over-summarizing to the point of losing critical details
