### Core Concept

Every expert who works with General Agents builds a personal prompt toolkit. Proven patterns get documented. New problems get solved by adapting existing templates.

### Key Mental Models

- **Pattern over command**: You're collecting reusable prompt structures, not specific commands.
- **Toolkit grows with you**: Every time you discover something that works, add it to the collection.
- **Search results are ephemeral, indexes are permanent**: Don't just find files — persist results into an index document so you never run the same search twice (Principle 5).
- **Manual to automated bridge**: This chapter teaches manual prompting. Later, you'll learn automation. Your patterns become the decision rules for AI Employees.

### Critical Patterns

- **Synthesize all six workflows**: Apply survey, safety, organization, batch, recovery, and search to a new folder (Desktop).
- **Create MY-PROMPT-TOOLKIT.md**: Document fill-in-the-blank templates for each workflow pattern.
- **Principle reflection**: Observe which principles emerged during each workflow and how they enabled success.
- **Transfer to new domains**: The same patterns work for email, calendar, projects, and any workflow where you direct General Agents.

### Common Mistakes

- Treating each lesson as isolated: The power comes from combining all workflows systematically.
- Not documenting your toolkit: You'll re-discover patterns instead of building on past work.
- Treating search as one-time: Finding a file without creating an index means searching again next time.
- Missing the automation connection: Manual prompting today becomes automated decision rules later.

### Connections

- **Builds on**: Lessons 1-6 (all workflows including error recovery), all Seven Principles from Part 1
- **Leads to**: AI Employees where manual prompting evolves into autonomous automation
