### Core Concept

Effective collaboration with General Agents starts with describing problems rather than solutions. You state what you want to understand, and let the agent figure out how to get there.

### Key Mental Models

- **Problem description over solution specification**: You describe outcomes, not procedures. The agent determines the technical approach.
- **Observation over memorization**: Watch what the agent does to learn patterns without rote memorization of commands.
- **Prompt patterns transfer**: The "help me understand" pattern works for files, data analysis, project planning, and any domain where you direct General Agents.
- **Know when you're faster**: If you can do it faster than you can describe it, just do it. Three files to move? Drag them. Three hundred to categorize? Agent territory.

### Critical Patterns

- **"Help me understand [problem], show me [what I need]"**: This universal prompt pattern triggers the agent to analyze and report findings.
- **Principle 1 (Bash is the Key)**: The agent combines basic Unix commands (`ls`, `find`, `wc`, `du`) to extract exactly the information you need.
- **Principle 7 (Observability)**: The agent makes chaos visible through structured reports showing file counts, types, and space usage.

### Common Mistakes

- Specifying technical commands instead of describing the problem: "Run `find` and `du`" limits the agent to your approach.
- Skipping the observation phase: Missing how the agent works means you don't learn reusable patterns.
- Not defining what success looks like: Vague requests like "look at my files" produce unfocused responses.
- Using the agent when you're faster: Browsing photo thumbnails, moving 3 files, peeking at a file — some tasks don't need an agent.
