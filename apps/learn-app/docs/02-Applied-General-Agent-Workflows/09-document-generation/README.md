# Chapter 9: Professional Document Generation

Your manager needs a project proposal by end of day. You need quarterly slides for the board. A client asked for a technical specification. Each document has a different format, tone, and structure — and you're starting from a blank page every time.

**The problem isn't writing. It's producing professional-quality documents consistently and quickly.**

This chapter teaches you to use your General Agent for structured document generation — proposals, reports, presentations, and specifications. You'll learn to describe what you need, provide context, and let the agent produce polished drafts that you refine with your expertise.

## Principles Applied

| Principle | How It Applies |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Code as Universal Interface** | Document templates expressed as structured formats, not vague instructions |
| **Persisting State in Files** | Templates and style guides saved for reuse across projects |
| **Constraints and Safety** | Tone guidelines, format requirements, and audience awareness |
| **Bash is the Key** | File operations for organizing document outputs and managing versions |

## Interface Focus

**Primary**: Cowork (iterative drafting and refinement)
**Secondary**: Code (for template creation and format conversion)

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- Create document templates that encode your organization's standards
- Generate professional proposals, reports, and specifications from brief inputs
- Iterate on drafts with focused revision prompts
- Convert between formats (markdown to slides, notes to formal documents)
- Build a library of reusable document patterns

## Connection to AI Employee (Chapter 11)

The document generation patterns you build here power your AI Employee's output capabilities. In Chapter 11, your employee uses these techniques to:

- Draft email responses in your voice and style
- Generate weekly status reports from activity logs
- Produce the formatted "CEO Briefing" document
- Create meeting summaries and action item lists

**Documents are how your AI Employee communicates on your behalf.**
