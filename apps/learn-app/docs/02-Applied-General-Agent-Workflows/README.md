# Part 2: Applied General Agent Workflows

You understand the paradigm. You know the Seven Principles. You've seen what General Agents can do.

**Now it's time to use them on real problems.**

This part is a progressive skills lab. Each chapter tackles a specific problem domain — organizing files, synthesizing research, analyzing data, generating documents, and managing versions. By the end, you combine everything into a working AI Employee that operates autonomously on your behalf.

## The Progressive Arc

Each chapter solves a real-world problem while explicitly applying the Seven Principles from Chapter 4. The complexity builds:

```
Ch 6: File Processing         → Navigate and organize (Bash is the Key)
Ch 7: Research Synthesis      → Gather and compare (Verification)
Ch 8: Data Analysis           → Calculate and validate (Code as Interface)
Ch 9: Document Generation     → Produce and refine (Persisting State)
Ch 10: Version Control         → Track and recover (Reversible Decomposition)
Ch 11: Build Your AI Employee → COMBINE EVERYTHING (All Seven Principles)
```

## What You'll Build

| Chapter | Problem You Solve | Primary Principle | Output |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **6. File Processing** | 2,000 unsorted files | Bash is the Key | Organized project structure |
| **7. Research Synthesis** | 20 browser tabs, no synthesis | Verification | Decision document |
| **8. Data Analysis** | Raw spreadsheet, no insights | Code as Universal Interface | Financial model |
| **9. Document Generation** | Blank page, deadline tomorrow | Persisting State in Files | Professional document suite |
| **10. Version Control** | Experimental changes, no safety net | Small, Reversible Decomposition | Git-tracked project |
| **11. AI Employee** | All of the above, 24/7 | **All Seven Principles** | Working Digital FTE |

## Two Interfaces, One Agent

Throughout this part, you'll use your General Agent through two interfaces:

- **Code** (Claude Code): For precise operations — file processing, data analysis, version control, automation scripts
- **Cowork** (Claude Desktop): For iterative work — research synthesis, document generation, planning strategies

Each chapter specifies which interface suits the problem. By Chapter 10, you'll fluidly switch between both.

## Chapter Overview

### Chapter 6: File Processing & System Navigation

Your downloads folder has 2,000 files. Learn to navigate and process files using terminal commands you understand, verify operations are safe, and collaborate with AI on filesystem tasks.

**Principle focus**: Bash is the Key, Verification, Safety

### Chapter 7: Research & Knowledge Synthesis

You need to make an informed decision. Learn to delegate research, synthesize multiple sources, and produce structured comparison documents.

**Principle focus**: Verification, Persisting State, Observability

### Chapter 8: Data Analysis & Financial Modeling

You have raw data and need insights. Learn to connect to spreadsheets, build financial models, and apply governance to analytical workflows.

**Principle focus**: Code as Universal Interface, Verification, Safety

### Chapter 9: Professional Document Generation

You have a blank page and a deadline. Learn to generate professional proposals, reports, and specifications from structured inputs.

**Principle focus**: Persisting State, Constraints, Code as Interface

### Chapter 10: Version Control & Safe Experimentation

You want to experiment without breaking things. Learn Git as a safety net that enables confident, reversible changes.

**Principle focus**: Small Reversible Decomposition, Verification, Observability

### Chapter 11: Build Your AI Employee (Capstone)

Combine everything into a working Digital FTE that processes files, researches answers, analyzes data, generates documents, tracks changes safely, and operates 24/7 on your behalf. This capstone chapter incorporates automation patterns alongside all other workflow types.

**Principle focus**: All Seven Principles

## A Note on Mindset

The most important thing you'll develop in this part isn't tool proficiency — it's the ability to decompose real problems into agent-solvable tasks.

Each chapter starts with a problem you recognize from your own work. The solution always follows the same pattern:

1. **Describe** what you need (not how to do it)
2. **Verify** the agent understood correctly
3. **Execute** in small, reversible steps
4. **Persist** the output for future reuse

This is the General Agent workflow. By Chapter 11, it will be second nature.
