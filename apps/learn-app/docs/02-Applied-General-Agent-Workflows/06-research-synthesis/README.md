# Chapter 5: Research & Knowledge Synthesis

You need to make an informed decision — choosing a technology, evaluating a competitor, or understanding a market trend. Today, that means opening 20 browser tabs, skimming articles, losing track of which source said what, and ultimately making a decision based on incomplete information and gut feeling.

**The problem isn't finding information. It's synthesizing it.**

This chapter teaches you to delegate research workflows to your General Agent. Instead of manually collecting, reading, and comparing sources, you'll describe what you need to know, let the agent gather and structure the information, then apply your judgment to a well-organized synthesis.

## Principles Applied

| Principle | How It Applies |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Code as Universal Interface** | Research queries expressed as structured prompts, not vague questions |
| **Verification as Core Step** | Cross-reference claims across sources; never trust a single result |
| **Persisting State in Files** | Save research artifacts as markdown files for future reference |
| **Observability** | Agent shows its sources, reasoning, and confidence levels |

## Interface Focus

**Primary**: Cowork (research is conversational and iterative)
**Secondary**: Code (for structured output formatting)

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- Frame research questions that produce actionable results
- Use your General Agent to gather, compare, and synthesize information from multiple sources
- Create structured comparison documents (feature matrices, pros/cons, decision frameworks)
- Verify claims and cross-reference sources systematically
- Build a personal knowledge base from research outputs

## Lesson Outline

| Lesson | Title | Focus |
|--------|-------|-------|
| L01 | Asking Better Questions | From vague curiosity to structured research briefs |
| L02 | Multi-Source Gathering | Directing your agent to collect diverse perspectives |
| L03 | Comparison & Evaluation | Building decision matrices and feature comparisons |
| L04 | Fact Verification Patterns | Cross-referencing and source credibility assessment |
| L05 | Knowledge Base Assembly | Organizing research outputs into reusable references |
| L06 | Research Synthesis Capstone | End-to-end research project producing a decision document |

## Connection to AI Employee (Chapter 10)

The research patterns you build here become the foundation for your AI Employee's intelligence. In Chapter 10, your employee uses these same synthesis techniques to:

- Monitor industry trends relevant to your business
- Compile competitive intelligence reports
- Research answers to questions from your inbox
- Generate the "Market Context" section of your CEO Briefing

**Research is how your AI Employee stays informed.**
