### Core Concept
The difference between demos and real work: demos impress at parties ("write a haiku"), real work saves your Tuesday morning ("sort my 47 emails and tell me which three need attention"). Your AI Employee proves its value by completing tasks that genuinely consume your time.

### Key Mental Models
- **Three Universal Tasks**: Email triage, research synthesis, and domain-specific work—applicable to nearly everyone
- **Delegation + Review**: You provide strategic direction, AI handles parallel processing, you evaluate and refine output
- **Honest Limitations**: A useful AI Employee tells you what it can't do and what capability it needs

### Critical Patterns
- Email triage prompt: Categorize as URGENT/IMPORTANT/FYI/SPAM, summarize urgent ones
- Research prompt: Structure output as tables with specific criteria (competitors, tools, investments)
- Always evaluate AI output for accuracy, completeness, and usefulness—don't blindly accept
- Use back-and-forth refinement to improve results ("add this competitor", "ask for sources")

### Common Mistakes
- Accepting AI output without verification (especially for research tasks)
- Using vague prompts instead of specific, structured requests
- Not adapting universal prompts to your specific domain
- Expecting perfect results on first try instead of refining iteratively
