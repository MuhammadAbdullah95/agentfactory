# Chapter 11: Meet Your First AI Employee

In January 2026, OpenClaw went viral—165,000 GitHub stars, the fastest-growing repository in history. It proved something profound: **AI Employees are real, they work, and people want them.**

This chapter gives you that experience. You'll have a working AI Employee on Telegram doing real work before you understand how it works. Then we'll peel back the layers, showing you the architecture, and teach you to build **portable skills** that work with OpenClaw, Claude Code, Claude Cowork.
