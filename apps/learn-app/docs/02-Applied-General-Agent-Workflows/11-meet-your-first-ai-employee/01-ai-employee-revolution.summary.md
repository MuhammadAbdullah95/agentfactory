### Core Concept
AI Employees are fundamentally different from chatbots: chatbots answer questions, AI Employees complete tasks autonomously. OpenClaw's viral success (165,000+ GitHub stars) validated that users want AI that **acts on their behalf**, not just AI that responds.

### Key Mental Models
- **Act vs Respond**: Chatbots wait for input and provide information; AI Employees take initiative and deliver completed work
- **Ownership vs Rental**: Personal AI assistants you control (like OpenClaw on a Mac Mini) versus cloud services you rent
- **Threshold Effect**: AI models crossed a capability threshold where they can reason through multi-step tasks without constant hand-holding

### Critical Patterns
- Identify AI Employee opportunities by finding repetitive, pattern-based tasks in your workflow
- Distinguish between tasks needing human judgment (keep) versus pattern-following tasks (automate)
- Skills you build should be platform-independent—they work with OpenClaw, Claude Code, or any MCP-compatible tool

### Common Mistakes
- Treating AI Employees like chatbots (asking questions instead of assigning tasks)
- Granting write permissions before testing with read-only access
- Building platform-specific solutions instead of portable skills
