### Core Concept
Templates encode your organization's standards into reusable formats. The email-templates skill provides structure (meeting recap, project update, follow-up) so your AI Employee produces consistently professional output that matches your company's communication style.

### Key Mental Models
- **Templates vs Instructions**: Skills tell AI *how* to think; templates give it *what* structure to follow
- **Consistency Through Format**: Pre-defined structures ensure every email follows the same professional standard
- **Context-Appropriate Selection**: Different templates for different purposes (internal vs external, urgent vs routine)

### Critical Patterns
- Template categories: Meeting Recap, Project Update, Follow-Up Request, Introduction
- Each template includes: When to use, Required sections, Tone guidance, Example structure
- Skill invokes templates by context: AI selects appropriate format based on the task
- Customization layer: Adapt templates to your organization's specific conventions

### Common Mistakes
- Using one template for all situations (each has a specific purpose)
- Not adapting templates to your organization's style
- Forgetting that templates complement the email-drafter skill, not replace it
- Over-specifying format when flexibility would produce better results
