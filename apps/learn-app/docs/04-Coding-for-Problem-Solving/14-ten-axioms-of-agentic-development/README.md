# Chapter 14: Ten Axioms of Agentic Development

## Overview

This chapter formalizes the ten foundational axioms that govern effective agentic software development. These axioms distill the principles discovered through Parts 1-3 into a rigorous framework that guides all subsequent technical work in Parts 4-6.

## Learning Arc

Students have already experienced these axioms implicitly through their work with General Agents (Part 1), Applied Workflows (Part 2), and SDD-RI Fundamentals (Part 3). This chapter makes the implicit explicit, providing the theoretical foundation for the Python programming and agent-building work ahead.

## Axioms

| # | Axiom | Core Insight |
|---|-------|--------------|
| I | Shell as Orchestrator | The shell is the universal coordination layer for all agent work |
| II | Knowledge is Markdown | All persistent knowledge lives in markdown files |
| III | Programs Over Scripts | Production work requires proper programs, not ad-hoc scripts |
| IV | Composition Over Monoliths | Complex systems are built from composable, focused units |
| V | Types Are Guardrails | Type systems prevent errors before they happen |
| VI | Data is Relational | Structured data follows relational patterns |
| VII | Tests Are the Specification | Test-Driven Generation (TDG) makes tests the source of truth |
| VIII | Version Control is Memory | Git provides the persistent memory layer for all work |
| IX | Verification is a Pipeline | CI/CD automates the verification of all changes |
| X | Observability Extends Verification | Runtime monitoring extends pre-deployment verification |

## Prerequisites
