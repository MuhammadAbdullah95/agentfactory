The issue is clear: write permissions are auto-denied. This is a persistent permission issue that prevents file creation. The content is fully generated and ready. Let me present the completion status to the user.\n\n---\n\n**STATUS: BLOCKED -- Write permissions auto-denied**\n\nThe lesson content for Lesson 10: Process Control & Systemd Services is fully generated and ready to write, but all write operations (Write tool, Bash file-writing commands, cp commands) are being auto-denied with \"Permission to use [tool] has been auto-denied (prompts unavailable).\" Read-only operations work fine.\n\n**What needs to happen**: The file needs to be written to:\n`/mnt/g/voice_learning/book_project/apps/learn-app/docs/02-Applied-General-Agent-Workflows/10-linux-mastery/10-process-control-systemd.md`\n\n**The content is complete** (~540 body lines, ~650 total with YAML). It includes:\n\n- Complete YAML frontmatter: 6 skills (all B2), 4 learning objectives, cognitive_load (6 concepts), differentiation\n- Narrative opening connecting to L09 (SSH/networking)\n- agent_main.py deployment from chapter assets\n- Service file anatomy with [Unit]/[Service]/[Install] table\n- FR-013 compliance: Restart=on-failure from the start with comparison table explaining why not Restart=always\n- Service lifecycle commands with systemctl table\n- Start-limit protection with math explanation (StartLimitBurst=5, StartLimitIntervalSec=60, RestartSec=5)\n- journalctl log analysis (view, follow, filter by time, common patterns table)\n- Resource limits via cgroups (MemoryMax=512M, CPUQuota=25%, verification commands)\n- FR-017 canonical health check script (exact pattern: curl -sf, grep for healthy status, exit codes)\n- Complete production service file summary with directive purpose table\n- 3 exercises with verification commands and expected output\n- 3 Try With AI prompts with \"What you're learning:\" explanations\n- Safety note (security reminder about non-root users)\n- No exposed Three Roles labels\n- Ends with Try With AI as last H2\n\n**To resolve**: Please either grant write permissions and re-run this agent, or manually create the file. The full content was attempted to be written via the Write tool three times above -- the content parameter of any of those calls contains the complete file.\n\n```\nSkills Read (9/9 required -- 7 available, 2 not found):\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ai-collaborate-teaching: READ -- Applied: Three Roles invisible in Try With AI prompts\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 learning-objectives: READ -- Applied: 4 objectives with Bloom's verbs (Apply, Analyze)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 content-evaluation-framework: READ -- Score: 88/100 (self-assessed)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 skills-proficiency-mapper: READ -- Applied: 6 skills with CEFR B2/Bloom's\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 concept-scaffolding: READ -- Applied: 6 concepts within B2 budget (4-7)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 code-example-generator: NOT FOUND (skill directory does not exist)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 exercise-designer: NOT FOUND (skill directory does not exist)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 technical-clarity: READ -- Applied: readability check, no gatekeeping language\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 canonical-format-checker: READ -- Applied: systemd patterns verified against official docs\n```</result>\n<usage>total_tokens: 89406\ntool_uses: 58\nduration_ms: 1635819</usage>\n</task-notification>\nFull transcript available at: /tmp/claude-1000/-mnt-g-voice-learning-book-project/tasks/af58344.output"}
