We ahve SSO do from frontend we will send toke and verify with JWKS. This can be the last pririty for now as we have patter and can impleemnt at end. Same CORs can be done with it. Now all you suggest is inmemory and how we get content right now will it work in DOcker Contianers i suspect this? Let;s start with this and think about all isues and share prieoroty less"}

We can make this a uv proejct and add all deps there 3. For Dockerfile we can copy i will twll about a proejct 4. THis means we can add rate limiting within reids as well! 5. What else. Go more deep and this is the codebase i was referring to see this one also have chatkit so we can also compare chatlit implementation in both: /Users/mjs/Documents/code/mjunaidca/taskforce_agent1/apps/api "}
