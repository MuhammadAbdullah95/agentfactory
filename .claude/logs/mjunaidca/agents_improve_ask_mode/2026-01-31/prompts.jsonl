Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute with precision.\n\n## Key Focus Areas\n\n### Typography\nChoose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt for distinctive choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n\n### Color & Theme\nCommit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n\n### Motion\nUse animations for effects and micro-interactions. CSS-only solutions for HTML. Motion library for React. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.\n\n### Spatial Composition\nUnexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n\n### Backgrounds & Visual Details\nCreate atmosphere and depth. Add gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders.\n\n## NEVER Use\n\n- Overused fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts\n- Cliched colors: purple gradients on white backgrounds\n- Predictable layouts and cookie-cutter patterns\n- Designs that lack context-specific character\n\nMatch implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist = elaborate code. Minimalist = restraint and precision.\n\"\"\""}
