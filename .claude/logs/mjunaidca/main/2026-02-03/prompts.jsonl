Executive Summary\nSpec-Driven Development (SDD) represents a paradigm shift in how software is created with AI assistance. Rather than treating AI coding agents as sophisticated autocomplete tools, SDD establishes specifications as the primary artifact of software development, with code becoming a generated output derived from these human-authored specifications.\nThis paper examines how Claude Code, Anthropic terminal-based agentic coding tool, enables practitioners to implement SDD workflows effectively. We explore the theoretical foundations, practical implementation patterns, and the ecosystem of tools that have emerged around this methodology.\nKey findings include:\n\nSDD reduces approval fatigue and context switching by front-loading review at specification phase gates rather than during implementation\nClaude Code subagent system enables parallel execution of research and implementation tasks while preserving context\nThe methodology excels for large refactors, migrations, and feature implementations with unclear requirements\nSDD is not universally applicable\u2014small bug fixes and single-file changes may be better served by traditional approaches\n\n\n2. Introduction: The Evolution from Vibe Coding to Spec-Driven Development\nThe emergence of AI coding assistants has fundamentally altered how developers approach software creation. In the early days of tools like GitHub Copilot, developers quickly adopted what has been termed vibe coding\u2014an intuitive, conversational approach where developers describe what they want and receive code in return. This method works remarkably well for quick prototypes and exploring possibilities.\nHowever, as practitioners moved from prototyping to building production systems, the limitations of vibe coding became apparent. As one analysis noted: The issue is not the coding agent coding ability, but our approach. We treat coding agents like search engines when we should be treating them more like literal-minded pair programmers.\nConsider a typical interaction pattern:\nHuman: Add a notification system to my app\nAI: Here is a basic notification component with toast messages...\n\nHuman: No, I need backend notifications for order updates\nAI: Here is a simple email notification service...\n\nHuman: It needs SMS too, and user preferences\nAI: Let me add an SMS provider and a preferences model...\n\n[And the cycle continues...]\nEach iteration loses context from previous discussions. The agent makes reasonable assumptions that turn out wrong. The resulting code may work but does not align with the project existing patterns or architecture.\nSpec-Driven Development emerged as a response to these challenges. Rather than iterative discovery through conversation, SDD provides comprehensive specifications upfront. The AI agent receives a complete picture of what to build, why it matters, and critically\u2014what NOT to build."}
