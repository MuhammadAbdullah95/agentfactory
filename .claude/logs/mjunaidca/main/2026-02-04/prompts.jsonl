The top view is really clutterred ad bad how can we improve this? 3. Even when i click on ask mode it auto sends a message and i suspect it;s socratic mode? An option can be ton change theme [ Solid Blue Button: Teach Me ] [ Outline Button: Ask ] [ Icon: Copy ]. Also The \"Copy\" button adds a lot of visual noise for a utility function.\n\nChange: Remove the text \"Copy\" and just use a copy icon (two overlapping squares).\n\nResult: This reduces the width of the button group, giving \"Teach Me\" and \"Ask\" more breathing room and making the whole toolbar feel less cluttered."}
