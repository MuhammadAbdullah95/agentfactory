See: \"\"\"The article discusses a significant architectural change in **Claude Code v2.1.3** (and later), where the previously separate \"Slash Commands\" and \"Skills\" systems were unified.\n\nHere are the key details of this update:\n\n### 1. The \"Merge\" Explained\n\nPreviously, Claude Code had two distinct tools:\n\n* **Slash Commands:** Simple, user-invoked shortcuts stored in `.claude/commands/` (e.g., typing `/test` to run a test script).\n* **Skills:** Complex tools stored in `.claude/skills/` that Claude could \"choose\" to use autonomously when it needed to perform a task.\n\n**The Update:** These have been merged into a single **\"Skill\"** architecture. Conceptually, a \"Command\" is now just a Skill that is manually invoked by the user, and a \"Skill\" is just a Command that Claude can invoke itself.\n\n### 2. What Changed for You?\n\n* **Unified Folder Structure:** While the `.claude/commands/` folder still works for backward compatibility, the recommended practice is to move everything to `.claude/skills/`.\n* **Dual Invocation:** Any tool can now theoretically be used in both ways (unless restricted):\n* **User-Invoked:** You can type `/skill-name` to force Claude to run it.\n* **Agent-Invoked:** Claude can automatically call that same skill if it thinks it will help solve your prompt.\n\n\n\n### 3. New Controls (YAML Frontmatter)\n\nSince everything is now a \"Skill,\" you gain more granular control over how these tools are used via the configuration block at the top of your markdown files:\n\n* **`user-invocable: false`**\n* *What it does:* Hides the skill from your `/` autocomplete menu.\n* *Use case:* \"Background knowledge\" skills (like a legacy system context) that Claude needs to read but you never need to type manually.\n\n\n* **`disable-model-invocation: true`**\n* *What it does:* Prevents Claude from running the skill on its own.\n* *Use case:* Dangerous or expensive actions (e.g., `/deploy-production`, `/wipe-database`) that should *only* happen when you explicitly type the command.\n\n\n\n### 4. Why This Matters\n\nThis update simplifies the mental model for developers. You no longer have to decide \"Is this a command or a skill?\" when creating a tool. You simply create a capability, and then define *who* is allowed to use it (you, the AI, or both).\"\"\""}

The thread went viral. Developers called it \"a watershed moment\" and \"game-changing.\"\n\nWhat made it so impactful wasn't exotic techniques. It was seeing how the features you've learned in this chapter combine into a production workflow that lets one person operate like a small engineering team.\n\nThis lesson maps Boris's workflow to everything you've learned\u2014and connects it to [official Claude Code best practices](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices)\u2014showing you what expert-level usage looks like in practice.\n\n* * *\n\n## The Fundamental Constraint: Context Window\n\nBefore diving into specific techniques, understand the principle that unifies all Claude Code best practices:\n\n> **Claude's context window fills up fast, and performance degrades as it fills.**\n\nThe context window holds your entire conversation: every message, every file Claude reads, every command output. A single debugging session can consume tens of thousands of tokens. As context fills, Claude may start \"forgetting\" earlier instructions or making more mistakes.\n\n**Why this matters for Boris's workflow:**\n\nBoris's Practice\n\nHow It Manages Context\n\n15-20 parallel sessions\n\nDistributes context across sessions instead of overloading one\n\nPlan Mode first\n\nAligns understanding upfront, reducing correction iterations\n\nSubagents for investigation\n\nExplores in separate context, reports back summaries\n\n`/clear` between tasks\n\nResets context for fresh starts\n\nTeam CLAUDE.md\n\nEncodes learning once, applies everywhere (no re-explanation)\n\nEvery practice in this lesson connects back to this constraint. When you understand context as the fundamental resource, the \"why\" behind each technique becomes clear.\n\n* * *\n\n## The Parallel Sessions Philosophy\n\nNote for Non-Coders\n\nBoris runs 20 sessions because he is managing a massive software product. **You do not need to do this.** Start with one session. The principle here is about *multitasking*\u2014like having three assistants working on different projects\u2014not about typing speed.\n\nBoris doesn't run one Claude Code session. He runs **15-20 concurrent sessions**: 5 numbered tabs in his terminal, 5-10 browser sessions on claude.ai/code, and additional sessions started from his phone each morning.\n\n> \"I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal. I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input.\"\n> \n> \u2014 Boris Cherny, X thread (January 2026)\n\n**What this reveals**: Claude Code isn't a tool you interact with one task at a time. It's a capacity you schedule\u2014like having a team of assistants who can work independently while you review outputs and provide guidance when needed.\n\n**Connection to Chapter Concepts**:\n\n-   **Lesson 01 (Origin Story)**: The agentic paradigm means Claude works autonomously. Parallel sessions multiply this agency.\n-   **Lesson 09 (Subagents)**: Each session is like a subagent with a specific task\u2014research in one, implementation in another, testing in a third.\n\n* * *\n\n## Plan Mode First (Always)\n\nBoris activates Plan Mode (Shift+Tab twice) for every non-trivial task. He iterates back and forth with Claude until the plan is solid, then switches to auto-accept mode for execution.\n\n> \"A good plan is really important!\"\n> \n> \u2014 Boris Cherny\n\n**The Pattern**:\n\n1.  Start with a goal (e.g., \"Add authentication to this project\")\n2.  Enter Plan Mode\n3.  Discuss and refine until the plan makes sense\n4.  Switch to auto-accept mode\n5.  Claude typically one-shots the execution\n\n**Why this works**: When you spend time on planning, you align Claude's understanding with your intent. The investment in planning pays off through faster, more accurate execution. No wasted iterations fixing misunderstandings.\n\n**Connection to Chapter Concepts**:\n\n-   **Lesson 09 (Subagents)**: Plan is a built-in subagent that researches your codebase and creates multi-step strategies\n-   The \"one task, one completion\" pattern applies\u2014Plan subagent does research, returns a plan, then main Claude executes\n\n* * *\n\n## CLAUDE.md as Team Infrastructure\n\nBoris's team maintains a shared CLAUDE.md file checked into git. The entire team contributes multiple times per week.\n\nThe key practice: **when Claude makes a mistake, document it immediately**.\n\n> \"Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time.\"\n> \n> \u2014 Boris Cherny\n\nThey also use GitHub's @.claude tagging feature during code reviews\u2014when a reviewer sees Claude could have done better, they update CLAUDE.md as part of the review process.\n\n**The Result**: Every mistake becomes a rule. The longer the team works together, the smarter Claude becomes at understanding their codebase and conventions.\n\n**Connection to Chapter Concepts**:\n\n-   **Lesson 05 (CLAUDE.md)**: You learned to create project context. Boris shows how it evolves into institutional memory for teams.\n-   Notice the learning loop: Claude makes a mistake \u2192 team corrects by updating CLAUDE.md \u2192 Claude improves. The team and AI teach each other through the shared context file.\n\n* * *\n\n## Specialized Subagents for Common Workflows\n\nBoris uses custom subagents for his most common workflows:\n\nSubagent\n\nPurpose\n\n`code-simplifier`\n\nCleans up code after Claude completes implementation\n\n`verify-app`\n\nDetailed end-to-end testing instructions\n\n`build-validator`\n\nValidates builds before merging\n\n`code-architect`\n\nArchitecture review for complex changes\n\n`oncall-guide`\n\nOn-call specific automation\n\n> \"Similar to slash commands, I think of subagents as automating the most common workflows that I do for most PRs.\"\n> \n> \u2014 Boris Cherny\n\n**The Pattern**: Identify workflows you repeat for every PR. Create a subagent that handles that workflow with specialized instructions.\n\n**The Investigation Pattern**: Beyond PR workflows, subagents are powerful for keeping your main context clean. When Claude researches a codebase, it reads many files\u2014all consuming your context. Instead:\n\n```\nUse subagents to investigate how our authentication system handlestoken refresh, and whether we have any existing OAuth utilities.\n```\n\nThe subagent explores in its own context window, reads relevant files, and reports back with findings\u2014all without cluttering your main conversation.\n\n**Connection to Chapter Concepts**:\n\n-   **Lesson 09 (Subagents)**: You learned to create subagents with `/agents`. Boris shows what a mature subagent ecosystem looks like.\n-   **Lessons 06-08 (Skills)**: Subagents are like skills with their own context and tool access\u2014specialized experts for specific phases of work.\n\n* * *\n\n## Verification is Everything\n\nThis might be the most important insight from Boris's workflow:\n\n> \"Probably the most important thing to get great results out of Claude Code: give Claude a way to verify its work. If Claude has that feedback loop, it will 2-3x the quality of the final result.\"\n> \n> \u2014 Boris Cherny\n\n**How he implements this**:\n\n-   Claude uses the Claude Chrome extension to test UI changes directly\n-   Opens a browser, tests the interface, iterates until the code works and UX feels good\n-   Domain-specific verification ranges from simple (running bash commands) to complex (browser or phone simulator testing)\n\n**The Philosophy**: You don't trust AI output\u2014you instrument it. Give Claude tools to check its own work, and quality improves dramatically.\n\n**Connection to Chapter Concepts**:\n\n-   **Lesson 10 (MCP Integration)**: MCP tools can include verification capabilities\u2014testing endpoints, validating outputs, checking UI state\n-   **Lesson 13 (Hooks)**: Hooks can trigger automated verification after Claude makes changes\n\n* * *\n\n## PostToolUse Hooks for Formatting\n\nBoris's team uses a simple but effective hook:\n\n```\n{  \"PostToolUse\": {    \"matcher\": \"Write|Edit\",    \"command\": \"bun run format || true\"  }}\n```\n\nThis runs the formatter after every file write or edit. Claude generates well-formatted code 90% of the time, and the hook handles the remaining 10% to prevent CI formatting failures.\n\n**Connection to Chapter Concepts**:\n\n-   **Lesson 13 (Hooks)**: You learned the PostToolUse pattern. This is a production example that prevents a common frustration (CI failures due to formatting).\n\n* * *\n\n## Permissions, Not Skip Permissions\n\nBoris explicitly avoids `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Instead, he uses `/permissions` to pre-allow commands that are safe in his environment:\n\n-   `bun run build:*`\n-   `bun run test:*`\n-   `bun run typecheck:*`\n\nThese permissions are checked into `.claude/settings.json` and shared with the entire team.\n\n**Why this matters**: Skip permissions trades safety for convenience. Pre-allowed permissions give you the convenience while maintaining the safety boundary\u2014Claude still asks before running unknown commands.\n\n**Connection to Chapter Concepts**:\n\n-   **Lesson 13 (Settings Hierarchy)**: Team-shared settings in `.claude/settings.json` ensure consistency across developers.\n\n* * *\n\n## Model Selection: Opus 4.5 with Thinking\n\n> \"I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything. It's the best coding model I've ever used, and even though it's bigger & slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it's better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end.\"\n> \n> \u2014 Boris Cherny\n\n**The Counterintuitive Insight**: A \"wrong fast answer\" costs more time than a \"right slow answer.\" Opus 4.5 requires less correction and iteration, making total task completion faster despite slower per-response times.\n\n**Connection to Chapter Concepts**:\n\n-   **Lesson 13 (Settings)**: Model choice is a settings configuration. Boris optimizes for total iteration time, not token cost or response speed.\n\n* * *\n\n## Session Management: Course-Correct and Recover\n\nThe official best practices emphasize aggressive session management. Claude Code's conversations are persistent and reversible\u2014use this to your advantage.\n\n**Course-Correct Early**:\n\n-   **`Esc`**: Stop Claude mid-action. Context is preserved, so you can redirect.\n-   **`Esc + Esc` or `/rewind`**: Opens the rewind menu to restore previous conversation and code state.\n-   **`/clear`**: Reset context between unrelated tasks. Long sessions with irrelevant context reduce performance.\n\n**Resume Conversations**:\n\n```\nclaude --continue    # Resume the most recent conversationclaude --resume      # Select from recent conversations\n```\n\nUse `/rename` to give sessions descriptive names (`\"oauth-migration\"`, `\"debugging-memory-leak\"`) so you can find them later. Treat sessions like branches\u2014different workstreams can have separate, persistent contexts.\n\n**When to Clear**: If you've corrected Claude more than twice on the same issue, the context is cluttered with failed approaches. Run `/clear` and start fresh with a more specific prompt that incorporates what you learned.\n\n* * *\n\n## Mapping the Complete Workflow\n\nHere's how Boris's techniques and official best practices map to what you've learned:\n\nPractice\n\nSource\n\nChapter Lesson\n\nYour Takeaway\n\nContext window constraint\n\nOfficial\n\nAll\n\nThe fundamental \"why\" behind every practice\n\n15-20 parallel sessions\n\nBoris\n\nL01 + L09\n\nThink of Claude as capacity to schedule\n\nPlan Mode first\n\nBoris + Official\n\nL09\n\nAlways plan before executing non-trivial tasks\n\nTeam CLAUDE.md in git\n\nBoris\n\nL05\n\nEvery mistake becomes a rule; context evolves\n\nSubagents for investigation\n\nOfficial\n\nL09\n\nKeep main context clean; explore in isolation\n\nSpecialized subagents\n\nBoris\n\nL09\n\nCreate subagents for repeated PR workflows\n\nVerification loops\n\nBoris + Official\n\nL10 + L13\n\nGive Claude tools to verify its own work\n\nPostToolUse formatting\n\nBoris\n\nL13\n\nAutomate the last 10% that causes CI failures\n\n`/permissions` over skip\n\nBoris\n\nL13\n\nPre-allow safe commands, share with team\n\n`/clear` between tasks\n\nOfficial\n\nSession mgmt\n\nReset context for fresh starts\n\n`/rewind` for recovery\n\nOfficial\n\nSession mgmt\n\nCheckpoints are reversible\u2014experiment freely\n\nOpus 4.5 choice\n\nBoris\n\nL13\n\nOptimize for total iteration time, not speed\n\n* * *\n\n## Common Failure Patterns (What to Avoid)\n\nThe official documentation catalogs failure patterns observed across many users. Recognizing these early saves time:\n\nPattern\n\nSymptom\n\nFix\n\n**Kitchen sink session**\n\nStarted with one task, asked unrelated questions, now context is cluttered\n\n`/clear` between unrelated tasks\n\n**Correction spiral**\n\nCorrected Claude twice, still wrong, correcting again\n\nAfter 2 failed corrections, `/clear` and rewrite the initial prompt\n\n**Over-specified CLAUDE.md**\n\nClaude ignores instructions; important rules get lost\n\nRuthlessly prune. If Claude already does it correctly, delete the rule\n\n**Trust-then-verify gap**\n\nPlausible-looking code that doesn't handle edge cases\n\nAlways provide verification (tests, scripts, screenshots)\n\n**Infinite exploration**\n\nAsked Claude to \"investigate\" without scoping; context fills with file reads\n\nScope investigations narrowly or use subagents\n\n**Meta-pattern**: Most failures stem from context pollution\u2014either too much irrelevant information, or failed approaches cluttering the conversation. When in doubt, start fresh.\n\n* * *\n\n## Operational Takeaways\n\nLooking at Boris's workflow and the official best practices, four principles emerge:\n\n**1\\. Context is the Constraint**\n\nEvery technique traces back to managing the context window. Parallel sessions, subagents for investigation, `/clear` between tasks, Plan Mode\u2014all prevent context pollution. Internalize this and the \"why\" behind every practice becomes clear.\n\n**2\\. Parallelization Over Optimization**\n\nMultiple simple sessions outperform one overloaded session. Don't try to make one conversation do everything\u2014distribute work across parallel Claude instances.\n\n**3\\. Plan Mode Discipline**\n\nPlanning isn't training wheels. It's the foundation. Boris uses it for every non-trivial task, not just when he's unsure. The investment in alignment pays off in execution quality.\n\n**4\\. Verification Infrastructure**\n\nQuality comes from feedback loops, not hope. Give Claude ways to check its work\u2014through MCP tools, hooks, subagents, or browser automation. Verification creates the iteration loop that produces excellent results.\n\n* * *\n\n## Try With AI\n\nApply what you've learned from the creator's workflow:\n\n**\ud83d\udd0d Analyze Your Current Practice:**\n\n> \"Compare my current Claude Code workflow to Boris Cherny's. I've been using \\[describe your typical usage pattern\\]. What's the biggest gap between my practice and his? Which of his techniques would have the most impact if I adopted it?\"\n\n**What you're learning:** Self-assessment against expert practice\u2014identifying your highest-leverage improvement opportunity rather than random experimentation.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf Implement Plan Mode Discipline:**\n\n> \"I want to start using Plan Mode consistently. Walk me through the workflow: I'll describe a task I need to complete, you help me create a solid plan before we execute. Let's practice with: \\[describe a real task you need to complete\\].\"\n\n**What you're learning:** The plan-first discipline on a real task. This isn't theory\u2014it's practice that builds the habit.\n\n**\ud83d\udd27 Create a Verification Subagent:**\n\n> \"Help me create a verify-app subagent for my project. My project is \\[describe your project\\]. What should this subagent check? What tools does it need? Walk me through creating it with /agents and testing it on my codebase.\"\n\n**What you're learning:** How to design verification infrastructure specific to your project. Boris's principle: quality comes from feedback loops, not hope.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Design Your Parallel Workflow:**\n\n> \"I want to experiment with running multiple Claude Code sessions. Help me think through: What tasks should run in parallel? How should I organize and track them? What system notifications should I set up? Start with 3 parallel sessions\u2014what should each one focus on for \\[describe your current project\\]?\"\n\n**What you're learning:** Parallelization strategy\u2014thinking about Claude Code as capacity to orchestrate, not a single conversation to manage.\n\n**\ud83e\uddf9 Practice Session Hygiene:**\n\n> \"I just completed \\[describe a task\\]. Before I start the next task, help me decide: Should I continue in this session or `/clear` and start fresh? What context from this conversation is worth preserving? What would pollute my next task?\"\n\n**What you're learning:** Context management discipline. Recognizing when accumulated context helps versus hurts is a skill that develops through deliberate practice.\n\n### Core Concept\n\nBoris Cherny's (Claude Code creator) workflow demonstrates how chapter concepts combine into production-grade Agent Factory practice: parallel sessions for capacity scheduling, Plan Mode discipline for alignment, team CLAUDE.md for institutional memory, specialized subagents for common workflows, and verification loops for quality assurance. One person operating like a small engineering team.\n\n### Key Mental Models\n\n-   **Capacity Scheduling**: Run 15-20 concurrent Claude sessions across terminal and browser. Claude isn't a single tool you interact with\u2014it's capacity you schedule like a team of assistants\n-   **Plan First, Execute Later**: Always enter Plan Mode for non-trivial tasks. Iterate on the plan until it's solid, then switch to auto-accept for execution. Planning alignment prevents wasted iterations\n-   **Verification-First Quality**: Give Claude ways to verify its own work (browser testing, MCP tools, hooks). This feedback loop 2-3x quality of final results. You don't trust AI output\u2014you instrument it\n-   **Every Mistake Becomes a Rule**: When Claude makes errors, immediately document in CLAUDE.md. The learning loop: Claude errs \u2192 team corrects \u2192 Claude improves. Team shares and evolves this file through code review, creating institutional memory that compounds\n\n### Critical Patterns\n\n-   Use Opus 4.5 with thinking\u2014\"wrong fast answer\" costs more time than \"right slow answer\"\n-   Create specialized subagents for repeated PR workflows (code-simplifier, verify-app, build-validator)\n-   Add PostToolUse hook for formatting to prevent CI failures on the last 10%\n-   Use `/permissions` to pre-allow safe commands rather than `--dangerously-skip-permissions`\n-   Share settings in `.claude/settings.json` for team consistency\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n-   Running single overloaded sessions instead of parallel simple ones\n-   Skipping Plan Mode because \"this seems simple\"\u2014Boris uses it for every non-trivial task\n-   Hoping output is correct instead of building verification infrastructure\n-   Using skip permissions instead of intentionally pre-allowing specific safe commands\n\n### Connections\n\n-   **Synthesizes**: All Chapter 3 lessons\u2014Origin Story (agency), CLAUDE.md (context), Skills (expertise), MCP (tools), Subagents (delegation), Hooks (automation), Settings (configuration)\n-   **Demonstrates**: Real-world Agent Factory implementation at Anthropic production scale\n-   **Leads to**: Part 3 (Spec-Driven Development), Part 6 (Custom Agent SDKs), Part 7 (Digital FTE Deployment)\n-   **Digital FTE Link**: Each capability maps to productizable agent components\u2014skills become assets, CLAUDE.md becomes team memory, subagents become orchestration patterns\n\n---\nSource: https://agentfactory.panaversity.org/docs/General-Agents-Foundations/general-agents/creator-workflow\"\"\" Reread the thread and share https://x.com/bcherny/status/2017742741636321619 \"\"\"Here's the full thread from the provided link (starting with the main post by @bcherny on January 31, 2026).
