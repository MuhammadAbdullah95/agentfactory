Write Lesson 3: Lost in the Middle — Where Information Goes to Die

**CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES**:
- Output file: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/03-lost-in-the-middle.md`
- Execute autonomously - DO NOT ask "Should I proceed?"
- DO NOT create new directories - use the path exactly as specified
- Write the file directly after gathering context

**Quality Reference**: Read `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/01-manufacturing-quality-problem.md` for voice and structure.

**Research Source**: Read `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/workspace/chapter4-context-engineering-DEEP-v3.md` for Lesson 3 content details.

**Content Requirements**:

1. **Full YAML Frontmatter** including:
   - sidebar_position: 3
   - title, description, keywords
   - chapter: 4, lesson: 3
   - duration_minutes: 45
   - skills, learning_objectives, cognitive_load, differentiation

2. **Core Content**:
   - CITE: Liu et al. 2023 "Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts" (Stanford/Berkeley)
   - 30% accuracy drop for middle vs edge positioning
   - Primacy effect (first items anchor attention)
   - Recency effect (last items freshest in memory)
   - Middle blindness phenomenon
   - Three-zone CLAUDE.md strategy:
     - Zone 1 (Beginning 10%): Critical constraints, identity, must-follow rules
     - Zone 2 (Middle 80%): Reference material, project structure, nice-to-haves
     - Zone 3 (End 10%): Workflow instructions, current task, what you want NOW

3. **Lab: Position Sensitivity Test**:
   - Objective: Measure how position affects instruction following
   - Protocol: Add test instruction to beginning/middle/end of CLAUDE.md, measure compliance across 5 file creations each
   - Deliverable: Compliance rates by position (table proving position matters)

4. **Try With AI** (3 prompts):
   - Prompt 1: Position audit (identify current position of each CLAUDE.md section)
   - Prompt 2: Restructure proposal (apply three-zone strategy)
   - Prompt 3: Stress test (verify improved recall after restructuring)
   - Each prompt has "What you're learning" explanation

5. **Constitutional Requirements**:
   - Every code block MUST have **Output:** section
   - End with "## Try With AI" section (no summary after)
   - NO framework labels or meta-commentary

Return ONLY: "✅ Wrote [path] ([N] lines)"
