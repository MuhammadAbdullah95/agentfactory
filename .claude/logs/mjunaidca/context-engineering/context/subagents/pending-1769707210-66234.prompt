Research memory systems for AI agents as a new paradigm of context engineering. Key topics:

1. **Why Memory Matters Now**:
   - Context pollution / "context rot"
   - Why larger context windows aren't the answer
   - Human memory parallels: working, short-term, long-term memory

2. **Three Design Philosophies**:
   - Vector store approach (memory as retrieval) - Pinecone, Weaviate
   - Summarization approach (memory as compression)
   - Graph approach (memory as knowledge) - Zep, temporal knowledge graphs

3. **Startup landscape**:
   - Zep: Temporal Knowledge Graph (18.5% accuracy improvement, 90% latency cut)
   - Mem0: structured summarization, conflict resolution (26% accuracy gain)
   - Letta: simple filesystem memory outperforming specialized systems

4. **Architecture of Remembering**:
   - Extraction: salience detection
   - Consolidation: recursive re-encoding, preventing context drift
   - Retrieval: weighting by recency and importance

5. **Ethics of Forgetting** - GDPR, deletion protocols, bias in selective recall
