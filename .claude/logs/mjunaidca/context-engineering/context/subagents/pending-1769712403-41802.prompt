Write Lesson 9: Context Isolation — Why Clean Slates Beat Dirty States

**CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES**:
- Output file: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/09-context-isolation.md`
- Execute autonomously - DO NOT ask "Should I proceed?"
- Write the file directly after gathering context

**Research Source**: Read `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/workspace/chapter4-context-engineering-DEEP-v3.md` for Lesson 9 content.

**Content Requirements**:

1. **Full YAML Frontmatter** (sidebar_position: 9, chapter: 4, lesson: 9, duration: 60 min)

2. **Core Content**:
   - The Dirty Slate Problem:
     - Linear pipeline: Agent A → (accumulates) → Agent B → (more) → Agent C
     - By Agent C, context polluted with irrelevant A and B content
   - The Clean Context Pattern:
     - Orchestrator delegates with fresh context to each subagent
     - Each subagent uses FULL attention budget for its task
     - Subagents return summaries only
     - Orchestrator synthesizes
   - Context Isolation Benefits:
     - Full attention budget per task
     - No pollution from irrelevant work
     - Easier debugging (which agent failed?)
     - Parallel execution possible
   - Subagent Design Patterns:
     - Stateless (Subagent): Fresh context each call, strong isolation
     - Stateful (Handoff): Context transfers between agents
     - Shared (Network): Common memory layer, agents read/write
   - Context Amnesia Workarounds:
     - Preload Skills with project knowledge
     - Master-clone: subagent reads full CLAUDE.md
     - Include critical context in delegation prompt
   - Tool access control by role

3. **Lab: Dirty Slate vs Clean Context Comparison**:
   - Objective: See the difference between polluted and isolated context
   - Protocol: Design 3-step task (Research → Analyze → Write), implement both patterns, compare quality
   - Deliverable: Evidence of which pattern produces better results

4. **Try With AI** (3 prompts with "What you're learning" explanations)

5. **Layer**: L3 (Intelligence Design) - creates reusable orchestration pattern

Return ONLY: "✅ Wrote [path] ([N] lines)"
