Write Lesson 7: Long-Horizon Work — Progress Files and Session Architecture

**CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES**:
- Output file: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/07-progress-files.md`
- Execute autonomously - DO NOT ask "Should I proceed?"
- Write the file directly after gathering context

**Research Source**: Read `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/workspace/chapter4-context-engineering-DEEP-v3.md` for Lesson 7 content.

**Content Requirements**:

1. **Full YAML Frontmatter** (sidebar_position: 7, chapter: 4, lesson: 7, duration: 90 min)

2. **Core Content**:
   - Harrison Chase's Harness Architecture:
     - Traditional: [User] → [Single Agent] → [Output]
     - Long-horizon: [Initializer Agent] → [Progress File] ← [Coding Agent Sessions 1-N]
   - Two-Agent System (Initializer + Coding Agent)
   - Progress file template (claude-progress.txt):
     - Completed (with session markers)
     - In Progress
     - Blocked
     - Decisions Made
     - Known Issues
   - Feature decomposition (10-15 granular tasks, not vague goals)
   - Session initialization protocol (pwd, read progress, check git, select task, run tests)
   - Session exit protocol (commit working code, update progress file)
   - Commit checkpoint pattern (never end with broken code)

3. **Lab: The Five-Session Feature**:
   - Objective: Complete a real feature across 5 sessions using progress tracking
   - Protocol: Define 5-hour feature, decompose into 10-15 tasks, complete across 5 sessions, retrospective
   - Deliverable: Working feature AND reusable progress file template

4. **Try With AI** (3 prompts with "What you're learning" explanations)

Return ONLY: "✅ Wrote [path] ([N] lines)"
