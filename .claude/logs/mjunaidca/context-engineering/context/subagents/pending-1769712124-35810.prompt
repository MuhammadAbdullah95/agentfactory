Write Lesson 4: Signal vs Noise — Auditing Your Context for Quality

**CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES**:
- Output file: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/04-signal-vs-noise.md`
- Execute autonomously - DO NOT ask "Should I proceed?"
- Write the file directly after gathering context

**Research Source**: Read `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/workspace/chapter4-context-engineering-DEEP-v3.md` for Lesson 4 content.

**Content Requirements**:

1. **Full YAML Frontmatter** (sidebar_position: 4, chapter: 4, lesson: 4, duration: 60 min)

2. **Core Content**:
   - 4-question audit framework:
     1. Would Claude ask me about this if I didn't include it? → SIGNAL
     2. Could Claude figure this out from reading the code? → NOISE
     3. Does this change frequently? → NOISE (link instead)
     4. Is this a default convention Claude already knows? → NOISE
   - <60 line CLAUDE.md target (research shows ~150-200 instruction limit)
   - Progressive disclosure via file references (@docs/X.md)
   - HumanLayer best-practice example (under 20 lines)
   - What counts as SIGNAL vs NOISE (with examples)

3. **Lab: CLAUDE.md Signal-to-Noise Audit**:
   - Objective: Reduce CLAUDE.md to <60 lines while INCREASING effectiveness
   - Protocol: Export current, classify each section, delete/move noise, compare before/after
   - Deliverable: Optimized <60 line CLAUDE.md

4. **Try With AI** (3 prompts with "What you're learning" explanations)

5. **Layer**: L2 (AI Collaboration) - apply audit framework WITH AI assistance

Return ONLY: "✅ Wrote [path] ([N] lines)"
