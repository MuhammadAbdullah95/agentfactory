Write Lesson 5: The Two-Way Problem — Getting Tacit Knowledge In and Out

**CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES**:
- Output file: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/05-tacit-knowledge.md`
- Execute autonomously - DO NOT ask "Should I proceed?"
- Write the file directly after gathering context

**Research Source**: Read `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/workspace/chapter4-context-engineering-DEEP-v3.md` for Lesson 5 content.

**Content Requirements**:

1. **Full YAML Frontmatter** (sidebar_position: 5, chapter: 4, lesson: 5, duration: 60 min)

2. **Core Content**:
   - The Two-Way Problem (Greg Foster):
     - Engineers → AI: Transfer tacit knowledge (unwritten rules)
     - AI → Engineers: Extract understanding from generated code
   - What IS tacit knowledge (unwritten rules engineers carry)
   - Strategies for getting knowledge IN:
     - Structured architecture documents for AI consumption
     - Encoded stylistic preferences (examples over rules)
     - Memory systems
   - OpenAI memory lifecycle: inject → reason → distill → consolidate
   - Global vs session memory scoping
   - Strategies for getting understanding OUT (require explanations, structured output)

3. **Lab: Tacit Knowledge Extraction**:
   - Objective: Transform 10 minutes of verbal explanation into effective AI context
   - Protocol: Record explanation, transcribe, extract non-documented knowledge, encode as CLAUDE.md/Skills
   - Deliverable: Tacit knowledge document capturing what experienced engineers carry

4. **Try With AI** (3 prompts with "What you're learning" explanations)

5. **Layer**: L2 (AI Collaboration) - bidirectional knowledge exchange

Return ONLY: "✅ Wrote [path] ([N] lines)"
