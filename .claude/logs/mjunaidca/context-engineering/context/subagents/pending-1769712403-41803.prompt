Write Lesson 10: The Context Engineering Playbook — Decision Frameworks for Quality

**CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES**:
- Output file: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/10-context-engineering-playbook.md`
- Execute autonomously - DO NOT ask "Should I proceed?"
- Write the file directly after gathering context

**Research Source**: Read `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/workspace/chapter4-context-engineering-DEEP-v3.md` for Lesson 10 content.

**Content Requirements**:

1. **Full YAML Frontmatter** (sidebar_position: 10, chapter: 4, lesson: 10, duration: 120 min)

2. **Core Content**:
   - **Back to the Thesis**: "General Agents BUILD Custom Agents"
     - What separates $50/month agent from $5,000/month agent? Context engineering.
   - Context Engineering Decision Tree (when to use which technique):
     - Is context over 70%? → Compaction needed
     - Is task multi-session? → Progress file architecture
     - Is workflow drifting? → PreToolUse memory injection
     - Is work multi-agent? → Context isolation
   - Context Budget Allocation:
     - System prompt: 5-10%
     - CLAUDE.md: 5-10%
     - Tool definitions: 10-15%
     - Message history: 30-40%
     - Tool outputs: 20-30%
     - Reserve buffer: 10-15%
   - Seven Token Budgeting Strategies
   - When-to-use-what framework (table mapping situations to techniques)
   - Quality Assessment Criteria:
     - Consistency (turn 1 vs turn 50)
     - Persistence (session resume after 24h)
     - Scalability (multi-step without drift)
     - Knowledge (applies domain expertise automatically)

3. **Lab: Build Your First Production-Quality Agent**:
   - Objective: Apply full toolkit to build agent worth showing to clients
   - Protocol:
     1. Foundation: Audit/optimize CLAUDE.md (<60 lines, position-sensitive)
     2. Persistence: Extract tacit knowledge, create progress architecture
     3. Memory: Build semantic memory store, implement PreToolUse hook
     4. Scale: Design subagent architecture, implement context isolation
     5. Quality Gate: Run verification tests
   - Deliverable: Production-quality specialized agent with quality verification evidence

4. **Try With AI** (3 prompts):
   - Quality checklist assessment
   - Client pitch (technical → business value)
   - Improvement roadmap (prioritize by effort vs impact)

5. **Explicit Thesis Callback and Principle 5 Connection**

6. **Layer**: L4 (Spec-Driven Integration) - capstone producing sellable Digital FTE
