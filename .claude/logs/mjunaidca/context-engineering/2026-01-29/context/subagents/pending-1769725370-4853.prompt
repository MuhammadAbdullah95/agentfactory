You are merging two overlapping lessons into one comprehensive lesson.

## Context
Chapter 4 (Context Engineering) has two lessons that significantly overlap:
- Lesson 02: "The Attention Budget" - covers U-shaped curve, n² scaling
- Lesson 03: "Lost in the Middle" - covers THE SAME U-curve diagram, Three-Zone Strategy

They literally show the same ASCII art U-curve diagram. This is redundant.

## Task
Merge these into a SINGLE comprehensive lesson that:
1. Keeps the title "The Attention Budget: Why Position Matters"
2. Includes the U-curve explanation ONCE (not twice)
3. Includes the Liu et al. research citation from Lesson 3
4. Includes the Three-Zone Strategy from Lesson 3
5. Includes the n² scaling mechanics from Lesson 2
6. Includes the domain examples (Legal, Marketing, Research) from Lesson 3
7. Maintains full YAML frontmatter with skills, learning_objectives, cognitive_load, differentiation
