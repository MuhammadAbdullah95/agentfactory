Rework Lesson 6 (Tacit Knowledge) to be domain-neutral and accessible to professionals in ANY field (legal, marketing, research, business, operations), not just software developers.

**File to update**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/06-tacit-knowledge.md`

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Keep the same YAML frontmatter (only update description/keywords to be more inclusive)
2. Keep the structure: two-way problem, strategies for knowledge IN, strategies for understanding OUT, lab
3. Make ALL examples domain-neutral by adding multi-domain versions:
   - Legal: Contract negotiation history, case precedents, client preferences
   - Marketing: Brand voice nuances, audience insights, campaign learnings  
   - Research: Methodology choices, literature interpretation, citation standards
   - Consulting: Client relationship context, industry knowledge, deliverable formats
   - Business Analysis: Process insights, stakeholder preferences, historical decisions
   - Code examples can stay but label them as ONE of several domain options

4. The opening scenario should be universally relatable (experienced professional with undocumented knowledge), not just about code architecture

5. Update the lab to offer 5 domain contexts (Legal Review, Marketing Campaign, Research Paper, Business Process, Software Project)

6. Update "Try With AI" prompts to be domain-neutral (don't assume coding context)

7. Preserve the core concepts: Two-way problem, tacit vs explicit knowledge, memory systems, global vs session memory

**Execute autonomously - DO NOT ask for confirmation. Write the file directly.**
