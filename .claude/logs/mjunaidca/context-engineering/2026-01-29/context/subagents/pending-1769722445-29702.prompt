Rework Lesson 9 (Memory Injection) to be domain-neutral and accessible to professionals in ANY field (legal, marketing, research, business, operations), not just software developers.

**File to update**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/09-memory-injection.md`

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Keep the same YAML frontmatter (only update description/keywords to be more inclusive)
2. Keep the structure: Workflow drift problem, Two injection timing strategies, PreToolUse architecture, Building memory corpus, Lab
3. The concept of "workflow drift" applies to ANY domain - make this clear with examples:
   - Legal: Started reviewing contract terms, now focused on liability clauses, need different precedents
   - Marketing: Started with brand messaging, evolved to channel strategy, need different best practices
   - Research: Started with hypothesis, pivoted to methodology, need different citations

4. Memory corpus examples should span domains:
   - Legal: Precedent patterns, client preferences, judge tendencies
   - Marketing: Brand voice rules, audience insights, successful campaign patterns
   - Research: Citation standards, methodology conventions, reviewer preferences
   - Business: Process templates, stakeholder communication styles, industry conventions
   - Software (keep as ONE option): Error handling patterns, API conventions

5. The Lab should offer conceptual understanding first, with OPTIONAL technical implementation for those who want it. Not everyone will implement vector DBs.

6. Update "Try With AI" prompts to be domain-neutral

7. Preserve core concepts: Workflow drift, injection timing (UserPromptSubmit vs PreToolUse), thinking block extraction, semantic memory, deduplication
