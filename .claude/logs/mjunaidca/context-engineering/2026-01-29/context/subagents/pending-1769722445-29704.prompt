Rework Lesson 11 (Context Engineering Playbook) to be domain-neutral and accessible to professionals in ANY field (legal, marketing, research, business, operations), not just software developers.

**File to update**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/11-context-engineering-playbook.md`

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Keep the same YAML frontmatter (only update description/keywords to be more inclusive)
2. Keep the structure: Back to thesis, Decision tree, Context budget allocation, Seven token strategies, When-to-use framework, Quality criteria, Lab
3. The opening thesis should speak to ANY domain expert creating sellable AI agents, not just code developers

4. The Decision Tree scenario ("code review agent") should be replaced with multiple domain scenarios:
   - Legal: Contract review AI assistant
   - Marketing: Campaign planning AI assistant
   - Research: Literature synthesis AI assistant
   - Consulting: Proposal development AI assistant
   - Development (keep as option)

5. The Lab "Build Your First Production-Quality Agent" should offer 5 domain options:
   - Legal: Contract Review Assistant
   - Marketing: Campaign Strategy Assistant
   - Research: Literature Synthesis Assistant
   - Business: Process Improvement Assistant
   - Code Reviewer (keep as option, not default)

6. Quality criteria tests should include domain-neutral examples

7. Update "Try With AI" prompts to be domain-neutral

8. The chapter summary table should maintain the core insights but frame them for any professional

9. Preserve core concepts: Decision tree, context budget allocation, seven token strategies, quality assessment criteria (consistency, persistence, scalability, knowledge)
