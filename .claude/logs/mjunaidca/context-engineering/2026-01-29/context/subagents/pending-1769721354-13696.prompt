You are updating Lesson 2 (Attention Budget) of Chapter 4: Context Engineering.

**CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES**:
- Read the current lesson at: /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/02-attention-budget.md
- DO NOT change the core concepts (U-shaped attention curve, 70% threshold, zone system)
- DO make labs and examples domain-neutral

**Key Changes Required**:
1. Replace ALL code-specific examples with multi-domain examples
2. Labs should offer 3-5 domain options: Developer, Content Creator, Business Analyst, Legal Professional, Researcher
3. "Try With AI" prompts should be domain-neutral (not "review authentication module" but "analyze [your domain artifact]")
4. Add the 150-200 instruction limit research finding from Anthropic
5. Keep word count similar or slightly reduced

**Domain-Neutral Example Pattern**:
```
**Choose your domain:**
- **Software Development**: Analyze error handling patterns
- **Content Creation**: Evaluate content calendar strategy  
- **Business Analysis**: Review reporting methodology
- **Legal/Compliance**: Assess document formatting standards
- **Research**: Examine citation practices
```

Read the file, make updates to be domain-neutral, write the updated file back.
Execute autonomously without waiting for confirmation.
