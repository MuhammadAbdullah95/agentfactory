Rework Lesson 8 (Progress Files) to be domain-neutral and accessible to professionals in ANY field (legal, marketing, research, business, operations), not just software developers.

**File to update**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/08-progress-files.md`

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Keep the same YAML frontmatter (only update description/keywords to be more inclusive)
2. Keep the structure: Problem with long conversations, Harness architecture, Progress file anatomy, Feature decomposition, Session protocols
3. Make ALL examples domain-neutral:
   - The auth system example should be ONE of several domain options
   - Add parallel examples:
     - Legal: Multi-day contract negotiation, due diligence project
     - Marketing: Campaign launch with multiple phases
     - Research: Literature review spanning weeks
     - Consulting: Client engagement with multiple deliverables
     - Business Analysis: Process improvement initiative

4. The "Feature Decomposition" section should become "Task Decomposition" with domain-agnostic examples

5. The 5-Session Lab should offer 5 professional contexts:
   - Legal project (multi-phase contract review)
   - Marketing campaign (multi-week launch)
   - Research project (comprehensive literature review)
   - Consulting engagement (multi-deliverable project)
   - Software feature (keep as option, not default)

6. Git commit checkpoints should be generalized to "work checkpoints" with domain-specific save mechanisms (version control for docs, save drafts, create snapshots, etc.)

7. Update "Try With AI" prompts to be domain-neutral

8. Preserve core concepts: Harness architecture, progress file anatomy, task decomposition, session initialization/exit protocols

**Execute autonomously - DO NOT ask for confirmation. Write the file directly.**
