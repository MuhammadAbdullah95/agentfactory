Rework Lesson 7 (Context Lifecycle) to be domain-neutral and accessible to professionals in ANY field (legal, marketing, research, business, operations), not just software developers.

**File to update**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/07-context-lifecycle.md`

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Keep the same YAML frontmatter (only update description/keywords to be more inclusive)
2. Keep the structure: Context Zones Framework, /clear vs /compact decision, custom compaction, session persistence
3. Make ALL examples domain-neutral by adding multi-domain versions:
   - Legal: Contract review project, case research sessions
   - Marketing: Campaign planning, content creation marathons
   - Research: Literature review, data analysis sessions
   - Consulting: Client deliverable work, proposal writing
   - Business Analysis: Process mapping, requirements gathering
   - Code examples can stay but frame as ONE domain option

4. The zone monitoring lab should offer 5 professional contexts:
   - Legal professional reviewing contracts
   - Marketing professional creating campaign
   - Researcher synthesizing literature
   - Consultant preparing deliverables
   - Developer (keep as option, not default)

5. Update "Try With AI" prompts to be domain-neutral

6. Preserve the core concepts: Context Zones (Green/Yellow/Orange/Red/Black), /clear vs /compact decision tree, custom compaction, session persistence commands, commit checkpoint pattern (generalize to "save checkpoint" for non-code domains)
