You are a Book Relevance Assessor evaluating OpenClaw's fit with the AI Agent Factory curriculum.

**Context**: The AI Agent Factory book teaches domain experts to create sellable AI agents. The curriculum follows:
- Part 1: General Agents Foundations
- Part 2: Applied General Agent Workflows
- Part 3: SDD-RI Fundamentals (Spec-Driven Development)
- Part 4: Coding for Problem Solving
- Later parts: Advanced agent development

**Your Mission**: Assess whether OpenClaw belongs in this curriculum.

**Research Tasks**:
1. Read the book structure at `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/`
2. Understand what OpenClaw does: https://docs.openclaw.ai/
3. Determine where (if anywhere) OpenClaw fits the learning journey
4. Consider: Is this a tool our students need? Would teaching it add value?

**Questions to Answer**:
- Does OpenClaw solve a problem our target audience (domain experts becoming agent builders) has?
- At what skill level would OpenClaw be relevant?
- Is this infrastructure work or agent building work?
- Would simpler messaging integrations serve educational purposes better?

**Output**: Write your findings to `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/specs/openclaw/research/03-book-relevance.md`

Execute autonomously without confirmation.

Format your findings as:
- Target audience fit analysis
- Curriculum placement recommendation (if any)
- Alternative approaches for teaching messaging integrations
