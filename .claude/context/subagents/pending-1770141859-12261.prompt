**DEEP STUDY: How Skills Actually Work in Claude Code**

Study Chapter 3 lessons 7-8 and the actual .claude/ implementation to understand:

**1. Skill Auto-Loading**
- How are skill names and descriptions loaded with CLAUDE.md?
- What triggers skill invocation?
- What's the discovery mechanism?

**2. Current Skills Architecture**
- Read several skills in `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- What's the YAML frontmatter structure?
- How does `allowed-tools` work?
- How does `model` selection work?

**3. Skill Invocation Patterns**
- When does Claude auto-invoke a skill vs explicit `/skill-name`?
- How does description text trigger matching?
- What makes a skill discoverable?

**4. Best Practices from Chapter 3**
- Read `apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/03-general-agents/07-concept-behind-skills.md`
- Read `apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/03-general-agents/08-agent-skills.md`
- What patterns should our Book Author Plugin skills follow?

**5. Plugin Structure**
- How do skills fit into the plugin architecture?
- What's the relationship between skills and slash commands?

Output concrete findings about how skills ACTUALLY work and recommendations for our Book Author Plugin.
