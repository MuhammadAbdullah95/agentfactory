Create Chapter 5 Lesson 04: Phase 2 - Writing Effective Specifications

**Output path**: /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/05-spec-driven-development/04-writing-effective-specs.md

**Quality reference**: Read /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/01-manufacturing-quality-problem.md for format standards.

**Spec reference**: Read /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/specs/chapter-05-sdd/spec.md section "Lesson 04" for content requirements.

**Lesson content**:
- sidebar_position: 4
- chapter: 5, lesson: 4
- duration: 30 minutes
- Layer: L2

**Core content**:
1. Spec template structure (provide full template):
   - Part 1: Reference Architecture Analysis
   - Part 2: Current Architecture Analysis
   - Part 3: Implementation Plan
   - Part 4: Implementation Checklist
   - Constraints section
   - Success Criteria section

2. **What makes specs effective**:
   - Explicit constraints (what NOT to do is critical)
   - Measurable success ("< 100ms p95" not "fast")
   - Edge cases defined
   - Checklist format (enables task extraction)

3. **Anti-patterns**:
   - Specs that describe HOW instead of WHAT
   - Missing constraints
   - Vague success criteria

4. Addy Osmani's advice: Specs = PRD (why) + SRS (how)

**Opening hook**: "A spec is a contract between you and Claude. Vague contracts produce vague results."

**Try With AI prompts** (3 prompts):
1. "Convert these requirements into a structured specification: [paste requirements]"
2. "What's missing from this spec that could cause implementation issues?"
3. "Add explicit constraints and measurable success criteria to this spec"
