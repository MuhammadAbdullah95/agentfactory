**Lesson Structure**:
1. Compelling narrative opening: "Your Agents Run for Hours—What About Your Connection?"
2. Recap Layer 1 foundation from Lessons 1-2
3. Core tmux concepts with hands-on activities
4. **THREE ROLES DEMONSTRATIONS** (REQUIRED for Layer 2):
   - AI as Teacher: Suggests pane layout for monitoring agent logs while editing code
   - AI as Student: Student explains SSH timeout constraints, AI adapts session configuration
   - AI as Co-Worker: Iterate on session layout (3-pane → 4-pane with status bar)
5. 3 "Try With AI" prompts with "What you're learning:" explanations
6. Safety note (if applicable)

**Three Roles Requirements**:
- NO meta-commentary like "AI as Teacher" or "Part 2:"
- Make the framework INVISIBLE
- Each role should feel like natural collaboration
- Student experiences AI teaching them, them teaching AI, and working together

**Agent Scenario**: Use realistic agent deployment - running long-running training process while monitoring logs in adjacent pane
