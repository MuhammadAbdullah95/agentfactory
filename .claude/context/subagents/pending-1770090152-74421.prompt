**Quality reference**: Read /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/01-manufacturing-quality-problem.md for format standards.

**Spec reference**: Read /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/specs/chapter-05-sdd/spec.md section "Lesson 00" for content requirements.

**Lesson content**:
- sidebar_position: 0
- chapter: 5, lesson: 0
- duration: 15 minutes
- Layer: L1 (conceptual foundation)

**Core content**:
1. The vibe coding pattern: prompt → code → "no, I meant..." → code → repeat
2. Three failure modes:
   - Context loss: each iteration loses discoveries
   - Assumption drift: agent makes reasonable but wrong guesses  
   - Pattern violations: generated code doesn't match project architecture
3. Real example: notification system conversation that spirals (from research paper)
4. The insight: Claude needs the complete picture upfront, not iterative discovery

**Opening hook**: Start with the notification system example showing a typical vibe coding spiral.

**Try With AI prompts** (3 prompts):
1. Experience the problem: "Add a notification system to my app" (without specs)
2. Observe: Ask Claude what assumptions it made
3. Reflect: "What would you need to know upfront to build this correctly the first time?"
