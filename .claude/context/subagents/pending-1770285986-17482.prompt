Analyze the "Content Creator AI Employee" workflow the user described:

**The Workflow:**
1. Wake up
2. AI Employee plans your day's content
3. Creates video script/slides with NotebookLM
4. Uploads to YouTube channel
5. All communication via Telegram

**Questions to evaluate:**
1. Is this workflow technically feasible with OpenClaw + MCP?
2. What MCP servers would be needed? (YouTube, NotebookLM, etc.)
3. How much human-in-the-loop is realistic?
4. What's the time-to-value? (User said 1-2 hours)
5. Is this a compelling "Chapter 1" example for Part 2?

Research YouTube MCP servers, NotebookLM integration possibilities, content automation patterns.
