Validate the lesson file for constitutional compliance and educational quality standards.

**File to validate**: /mnt/g/voice_learning/book_project/apps/learn-app/docs/02-Applied-General-Agent-Workflows/10-linux-mastery/02-modern-terminal-environment.md

Read the file from disk and check:
- Framework invisibility (no "AI as Teacher", "Part 2:", meta-commentary)
- Evidence presence (70%+ code has output, claims have citations)
- Structural compliance (ends with "Try With AI/Practice/Explore" ONLY)
- Proficiency metadata (uses proficiency_level, not deprecated cefr_level)
- MDX safety (no angle brackets before letters/numbers like `<100MB`)

Return PASS/FAIL status with any violations found.
