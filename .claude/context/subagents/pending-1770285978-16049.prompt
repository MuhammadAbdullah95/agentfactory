Evaluate the idea of using OpenClaw as the ORCHESTRATION LAYER for the AI Agent Factory curriculum.

**The Concept:**
- OpenClaw runs as the always-on "AI Employee" 
- It manages Claude Code for coding/technical tasks
- It communicates via Telegram (secure, low cost)
- Students interact with their AI Employee through messaging

**Questions to evaluate:**
1. Can OpenClaw invoke/manage Claude Code? How?
2. What's the architecture: OpenClaw → Claude Code → Tasks?
3. Is this "AI Employee manages AI tools" pattern sound?
4. What are the advantages over the current Chapter 11 design (Obsidian + MCP + Claude Code)?
5. What's the realistic setup time for this stack?

Research OpenClaw's ability to orchestrate other tools/agents.
