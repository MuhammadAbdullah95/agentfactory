**Quality reference**: Read /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/01-manufacturing-quality-problem.md for format standards.

**Spec reference**: Read /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/specs/chapter-05-sdd/spec.md section "Lesson 01" for content requirements.

**Lesson content**:
- sidebar_position: 1
- chapter: 5, lesson: 1
- duration: 20 minutes
- Layer: L1→L2

**Core content**:
1. Three implementation levels table:
   | Level | Creation | Maintenance | Use Case |
   | Spec-First | Spec guides implementation | Spec discarded after | Most common; quick tasks |
   | Spec-Anchored | Spec written first | Both maintained | Team projects; living docs |
   | Spec-as-Source | Spec is primary artifact | Only spec edited | Experimental (Tessl) |

2. Most practitioners operate at Spec-First level
3. Spec-Anchored provides onboarding value (specs = documentation)
4. Spec-as-Source is emerging but introduces determinism challenges
5. The MDD parallel and why Spec-as-Source is risky

**Opening hook**: Frame as a maturity spectrum - you can adopt SDD gradually.

**Try With AI prompts** (3 prompts):
1. "Explain the trade-offs between maintaining specs alongside code vs regenerating code from specs"
2. "When would Spec-as-Source fail in a real project? Give me three scenarios."
3. "For a team of 5 developers, which SDD level would you recommend and why?"
