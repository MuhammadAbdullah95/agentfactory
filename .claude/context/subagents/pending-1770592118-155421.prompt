## Lesson Parameters

- CEFR: B2 | Bloom: Apply/Analyze | Layer: L2 (AI Collaboration) | Duration: 60 min
- sidebar_position: 9
- chapter: 10
- lesson: 9
- Max file size: 22KB
- New concepts (count: 6, at B2 limit):
  1. Ports and services (what port 8000 means, well-known ports, agent binding)
  2. localhost vs 0.0.0.0 (loopback vs all interfaces, security implications)
  3. curl for HTTP testing (GET, POST, checking agent health endpoints)
  4. SSH connection (ssh user@host, key-based auth)
  5. SSH config file (~/.ssh/config for multiple server aliases)
  6. Basic firewall with ufw (allow/deny/status, protecting agent ports)

## Learning Objectives

- LO-09-1: Explain ports, localhost vs 0.0.0.0, and why binding address matters for agents [Bloom: Understand | B2]
- LO-09-2: Use curl to test HTTP endpoints locally [Bloom: Apply | B2]
- LO-09-3: Establish SSH connections and configure ~/.ssh/config for multiple servers [Bloom: Apply | B2]
- LO-09-4: Configure basic firewall rules with ufw [Bloom: Apply | B2]

## Teaching Modality

Layered discovery — Start from "can I reach my agent?" and build diagnostic layers: localhost first, then network concepts, then remote access with SSH, then firewall.

## Three Roles Invisibility Strategy (CRITICAL — NO labels like "AI as Teacher")

The Three Roles Framework MUST be active but INVISIBLE. Never use labels like "Part 1: AI as Teacher" or "What to notice". Instead:
- **AI teaches (invisible)**: In Try With AI prompt 1, AI explains networking concepts (why 0.0.0.0 differs from 127.0.0.1) with diagrams the student requests
- **Student teaches AI (invisible)**: In Try With AI prompt 2, student describes their specific server setup and AI generates tailored SSH config
- **AI + Student converge (invisible)**: In Try With AI prompt 3, student and AI collaboratively debug a "connection refused" scenario step by step

## SSH Lockout Prevention Protocol (CRITICAL — from spec edge case)

Include step-by-step instructions that test key authentication BEFORE disabling password auth. Include explicit warning: "ALWAYS keep a backup session open when modifying sshd_config." This prevents students from accidentally locking themselves out.

## Exercises (3 required)

1. Use curl to test if anything is listening on port 8000 locally. Verify: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8000`
2. Generate an SSH key pair (if not already done in L08) and display the public key. Verify: `ls ~/.ssh/id_ed25519*` shows both files
3. Create an SSH config entry for a server alias. Verify: `grep -c "Host" ~/.ssh/config` shows entry count

## Try With AI (3 prompts required — L2 collaborative pattern)

1. "My AI agent is running on port 8000 but I can only reach it from the server itself, not from my laptop. Walk me through the diagnostic steps to figure out why." — What you're learning: AI teaches a systematic networking diagnostic approach: check binding address, then firewall, then routing.
2. "I have 5 servers I SSH into regularly. Here are their details: [list hostnames, users, ports, key files]. Generate my ~/.ssh/config file." — What you're learning: Translating your specific infrastructure into configuration is exactly where AI collaboration saves time.
3. "I want to lock down SSH on my agent server. Walk me through the changes to sshd_config, but make sure I don't lock myself out." — What you're learning: Safety-critical configuration changes benefit from step-by-step collaboration with verification at each stage.

## Content Structure Requirements

1. Full YAML frontmatter with skills (6 skills at B2), learning_objectives, cognitive_load, differentiation
2. Compelling narrative opening (2-3 paragraphs, real-world scenario about agent connectivity)
3. Every bash code block MUST have an **Output:** block showing expected output
4. 3 exercises with verification commands and expected output
5. 3 "Try With AI" prompts with "**What you're learning:**" explanations
6. End with "## Try With AI" as the LAST H2 section — NO Summary, NO What's Next sections
7. Admonitions: Use :::warning for SSH lockout prevention, :::tip for networking tips, :::note for WSL2 networking differences

## Skill Dependencies

This lesson builds on:
- L08 (SSH keys introduced in security context — students already have key pairs)
- L04 (apt for installing tools like curl, openssh-client, ufw)

Subsequent lessons that depend on this:
- L10 (Process control/systemd — needs networking for service access)
- L11 (Debugging — uses network diagnostic commands from this lesson)
