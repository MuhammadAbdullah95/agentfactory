Research the current SSO app at /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/sso to understand:

1. What auth configuration exists (look for auth.ts, auth-schema.ts, or similar)
2. What organization-related code exists
3. What role/permission code exists
4. What UI components exist for user management

Focus on:
- src/lib/auth* files
- Any organization or team related files
- Any role/permission files
- Dashboard or admin UI components

Output a structured summary:
- Current auth configuration
- Existing org features (schema, API, UI)
- Existing role features (schema, API, UI)
- Current UI components for management
- Gaps identified
