BEFORE VALIDATION - READ SKILLS FIRST (MANDATORY):
1. Read: .claude/skills/content-evaluation-framework/SKILL.md
2. Read: .claude/skills/ai-collaborate-teaching/SKILL.md
3. Read: .claude/skills/learning-objectives/SKILL.md

VALIDATION CHECKLIST (5 critical checks):

1. **Framework Invisibility** (Does lesson hide the teaching framework?)
   - [ ] NO meta-commentary about "AI as Teacher" or pedagogical layers
   - [ ] NO "In Part 2 you're learning..." or structural self-references
   - [ ] Content flows naturally, framework is INVISIBLE to student
   - If FAIL: Flag specific lines with meta-commentary

2. **Evidence Presence** (Are code examples well-marked?)
   - [ ] All code blocks have "Output:" or comment explaining what they do
   - [ ] Evidence blocks are present for: skill creation, example model, test code
   - [ ] At least 70% of code examples have Output blocks
   - If FAIL: List code blocks missing Output blocks

3. **Structural Compliance** (Does lesson follow L0 pattern?)
   - [ ] YAML frontmatter complete (type, lesson_number, learning_objectives, cognitive_load, skills)
   - [ ] Ends with activity/Try With AI section (NO Summary section after)
   - [ ] Contains 3 Try With AI prompts with "What you're learning" explanations
   - If FAIL: Flag missing sections

4. **Proficiency Alignment** (Is content appropriate for A1?)
   - [ ] No more than 6 NEW concepts introduced (this is A1 level)
   - [ ] Vocabulary matches A1 (simple, concrete language)
   - [ ] Examples are concrete and relatable (not abstract theory)
   - If FAIL: List concepts that exceed A1 level

5. **Skill-First Pattern** (Does L0 properly establish ownership mindset?)
   - [ ] Explicitly teaches that students will CREATE /database-deployment skill
   - [ ] Makes clear this skill is OWNED by student (not instructor-provided)
   - [ ] Shows progression table: what student learns → how skill updates
   - [ ] Empowering tone (student is builder, not recipient)
   - If FAIL: Flag where empowerment language is weak

SCORING:
- All 5 checks PASS → Return "✅ PASS: L0 educational validation complete"
- Any check FAIL → Return "❌ FAIL: [Check name] - [specific issue] - Fix required before L1"

Return ONLY the validation result (no explanation beyond what's needed to fix).
