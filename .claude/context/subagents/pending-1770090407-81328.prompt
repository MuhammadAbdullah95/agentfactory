Create Chapter 5 Lesson 03: Phase 1 - Parallel Research with Subagents

**Output path**: /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/05-spec-driven-development/03-parallel-research.md

**Quality reference**: Read /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/01-manufacturing-quality-problem.md for format standards.

**Spec reference**: Read /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/specs/chapter-05-sdd/spec.md section "Lesson 03" for content requirements.

**Lesson content**:
- sidebar_position: 3
- chapter: 5, lesson: 3
- duration: 30 minutes
- Layer: L2→L3

**Core content**:
1. **The prompt pattern**: "Spin up multiple subagents for your research task"
2. What happens: Claude spawns 3-5 independent agents, each investigating a different aspect
3. Real example from alexop.dev: IndexedDB migration research
   - Agent 1: CRDT data structures (CoMap, CoList patterns)
   - Agent 2: WebSocket sync protocols (4-message patterns)
   - Agent 3: Storage persistence patterns
   - Agent 4: Overall architecture
4. **Why parallel works**:
   - Each agent has independent context (no cross-contamination)
   - Research that takes sequential hours becomes parallel minutes
   - Different agents may discover different insights
5. Prompt template for research tasks

**Opening hook**: "What would take you 4 hours of sequential reading can be done in 20 minutes with parallel research agents."

**Try With AI prompts** (3 prompts):
1. "I want to understand how [reference repo] implements [feature]. Spawn multiple subagents for your research task."
2. "Summarize the key findings from each research agent in a comparison table."
3. "Based on this research, what patterns should I adopt vs avoid for my implementation?"
