- L1: From CSV to Databases (02-from-csv-to-databases.md)
- L2: Models as Code (03-models-as-code.md)
- L3: Creating & Reading Data (04-creating-reading-data.md)
- L4: Relationships & Joins (05-relationships-joins.md)
- L5: Transactions & Atomicity (06-transactions-atomicity.md)
- L6: Connecting to Neon (07-connecting-to-neon.md)
- L7: Capstone Budget Tracker (08-capstone-budget-tracker.md)
- README.md

VALIDATION FRAMEWORK (6-category rubric):

1. **Technical Accuracy (30%)**
   - All code examples valid SQLAlchemy ORM syntax
   - All database concepts correct (transactions, relationships, pooling)
   - All Neon setup instructions accurate
   - No deprecated APIs used
   - All connection pooling parameters correct

2. **Pedagogical Effectiveness (25%)**
   - Layer progression honored (L1 Manual → L2 Collab → L3 Skill → L4 Optional)
   - Cognitive load appropriate per proficiency (A1-A2)
   - Learning objectives measurable and aligned with content
   - Try With AI prompts have clear learning focus
   - Skill-first pattern reinforced throughout (L0 foundation, L1-L7 build)

3. **Writing Quality (20%)**
   - Clear, accessible prose for A1-A2 level
   - No gatekeeping language ("obviously", "simply", "just")
   - Consistent terminology across lessons
   - Technical clarity (jargon defined on first use)
   - Real-world examples (Budget Tracker coherent throughout)

4. **Structure & Organization (15%)**
   - All lessons end with activity (no Summary/What's Next sections after Try With AI)
   - YAML frontmatter complete in all lessons
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Code examples have Output blocks (70%+ coverage)
   - Checkpoints/verification present

5. **AI-First Teaching (10%)**
   - Three Roles Framework embedded in L4-L6 (not forced)
   - No meta-commentary exposing pedagogical layers
   - Framework is invisible to student (no "AI as Teacher" labels)
   - Authentic voice (teaching, not explaining the teaching)
   - Three Roles shown through natural collaboration scenarios

SCORING METHOD:
- Each category scored: (Actual Quality / Target Quality) × Weight
- Overall: Sum of weighted scores
- Threshold for PASS: ≥ 80% (minimum publishable)
- FAIL: Any category < 60% OR constitutional violations
