You are generating certification exam questions for Part 1: General Agents Foundations.

Read the grounding notes at: /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/assessments/part1-foundations-grounding.md

Generate 90 questions split into two types:
1. **Scenario-Based (45 questions)**: Present realistic workplace situations where the learner must apply concepts
2. **Transfer (45 questions)**: Apply learning to new domains/contexts not explicitly covered

**Question Distribution by Chapter:**
- Chapter 3 (General Agents): 26 questions (14 scenario, 12 transfer)
- Chapter 1 (Agent Factory): 23 questions (12 scenario, 11 transfer)
- Chapter 4 (Context Engineering): 18 questions (9 scenario, 9 transfer)
- Chapter 6 (Seven Principles): 18 questions (8 scenario, 10 transfer)
- Chapter 5 (SDD): 10 questions (5 scenario, 5 transfer)
- Chapter 2 (Markdown): 1 question (0 scenario, 1 transfer)

**Anti-Gaming Rules (CRITICAL):**
- Correct answers should NOT be the longest option
- Distribute correct answer positions evenly (A, B, C, D each ~25%)
- Avoid "All of the above" or "None of the above"
- Make distractors plausible (not obviously wrong)
- No pattern in correct answers (e.g., not mostly B or C)
