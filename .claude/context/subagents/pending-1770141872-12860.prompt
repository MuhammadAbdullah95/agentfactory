**DEEP STUDY: Hooks and Memory Injection Patterns**

Study Chapter 4 lessons 8 and the actual hooks implementation:

**1. Hook Types and Triggers**
- Read `apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/08-memory-injection.md`
- What hook types exist? (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, etc.)
- When does each trigger?

**2. Current Hooks Implementation**
- List all hooks in `.claude/hooks/` or project hooks config
- What's the settings.json or hooks configuration?
- What's actually implemented vs documented?

**3. Memory Injection Patterns**
- How do hooks inject context?
- What's the memory corpus pattern?
- How to prevent workflow drift?

**4. Auto-Injection Opportunities**
- Can we auto-inject branch + username?
- Can we inject task list ID automatically?
- Can we inject current chapter/lesson context?

**5. Session Management**
- SessionStart hooks - what should happen?
- SessionEnd hooks - what should be saved?
- How to coordinate multi-session work?

**6. Book Author Plugin Hooks**
- What hooks does our plugin need?
- Content validation hooks?
- Progress tracking hooks?
- Quality gate hooks?

Output concrete findings about hooks integration and recommendations for our plugin.
