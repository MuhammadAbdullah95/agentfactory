**DEEP STUDY: How Tasks System Integrates with Claude Code**

Study Chapter 4 lesson 4 and the actual implementation to understand:

**1. Tasks System Mechanics**
- Read `apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/04-tasks-system.md`
- How does TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList work?
- What's the persistence mechanism?

**2. Environment Variables**
- What env vars affect Tasks? (e.g., CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID)
- Can we auto-name tasks with branch + username?
- How do multiple sessions share tasks?

**3. Tasks + Plan Mode Integration**
- How do Tasks relate to Plan Mode?
- Can tasks be extracted from plans?
- What's the workflow?

**4. Artifact Preservation**
- Can tasks/plans be copied to specs/feature/ folder automatically?
- How do we preserve decision history?
- What hooks could automate this?

**5. Current Hooks**
- Check `.claude/hooks/` for task-related hooks
- What's already implemented?
- What's missing?

**6. Best Practices for Book Plugin**
- How should our Book Author Plugin use Tasks?
- Session naming conventions?
- Cross-session coordination?

Output concrete findings about Tasks integration and recommendations for our plugin.
