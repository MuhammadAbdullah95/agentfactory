Create Chapter 5 Lesson 06: Phase 4 - Task-Based Implementation

**Output path**: /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/05-spec-driven-development/06-task-based-implementation.md

**Quality reference**: Read /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/01-manufacturing-quality-problem.md for format standards.

**Spec reference**: Read /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/specs/chapter-05-sdd/spec.md section "Lesson 06" for content requirements.

**Lesson content**:
- sidebar_position: 6
- chapter: 5, lesson: 6
- duration: 35 minutes
- Layer: L3

**Core content**:
1. **The core prompt pattern**:
   ```
   Implement @docs/my-spec.md
   Use the task tool and each task should only be done by a subagent
   so that context is clear. After each task do a commit before you continue.
   You are the main agent and your subagents are your devs.
   ```

2. **What happens**:
   - Main agent extracts tasks from spec checklist
   - Each task delegated to fresh subagent (context isolation)
   - Subagent completes → commits → returns
   - Main agent tracks progress, handles blockers

3. **Task system operations** table:
   | Tool | Purpose |
   | TaskCreate | Define task with dependencies |
   | TaskUpdate | Transition status |
   | TaskList | View all tasks and blockers |
   | TaskGet | Retrieve full task details |

4. **Why context isolation matters**:
   - Each subagent starts fresh
   - If task fails, only that context is affected
   - Parallel tasks don't pollute each other

5. **Backpressure pattern**: Pre-commit hooks
   ```bash
   # .husky/pre-commit
   pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test-run
   ```

6. Real results from alexop.dev: 45 minutes, 14 tasks, 14 commits, 71% context usage

**Opening hook**: "You are the main agent and your subagents are your devs. This single prompt transforms Claude from a solo coder into a development team."

**Try With AI prompts** (3 prompts):
1. "Create a task breakdown for this spec: [paste spec]. Show dependencies between tasks."
2. "Implement task 1. After completion, commit with an atomic message describing what changed."
3. "Which of these tasks can run in parallel vs which must be sequential? Explain the dependencies."
