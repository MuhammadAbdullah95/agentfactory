# Task: Create Lesson 7 - Debugging & Troubleshooting

## Output Path
/mnt/g/voice_learning/book_project/apps/learn-app/docs/02-Applied-General-Agent-Workflows/10-linux-mastery/07-debugging-troubleshooting.md

## Learning Objectives (Already Generated)
1. Read system logs using journalctl (Analyze, B2)
2. Stream log output in real-time using tail -f (Apply, B2)
3. Test network connectivity using curl/wget (Apply, B2)
4. Diagnose network issues using ip addr, netstat, ping (Analyze, B2)
5. Monitor disk usage using df -h and du (Apply, B2)

## Exercise Ideas
1. Log analysis: Use journalctl to find service failure reasons
2. Network debugging: Diagnose connectivity issues step-by-step
3. Process troubleshooting: Identify runaway processes and resource usage

## Three Roles AI Partnership
- AI as Teacher: Teaches diagnostic methodology and systematic debugging
- Student teaches AI: Describes failure symptoms and context
- Co-Worker iteration: Systematic diagnosis together

## Reference Lesson
Match quality and structure of: /mnt/g/voice_learning/book_project/apps/learn-app/docs/02-Applied-General-Agent-Workflows/10-linux-mastery/03-persistent-sessions-tmux.md

## Content Requirements
- Full YAML frontmatter with skills, learning objectives, cognitive load
- Compelling narrative opening about production debugging
- Deep evidence with tables and diagnostic flows
- Three "Try With AI" prompts with learning explanations
- All examples use realistic agent troubleshooting scenarios
- B2 proficiency level (7-10 new concepts)

## Chapter Context
This is Lesson 7 of Chapter 10: Linux Mastery for Digital FTEs. Students have completed Lessons 1-6. They are ready for production debugging skills.

## Spec Reference
Full spec at: /mnt/g/voice_learning/book_project/specs/001-linux-mastery/spec.md

## Return Format
Return confirmation only (~50 lines max), NOT full content. Include file path and confirmation that lesson was created successfully.
