## Summary Format (Socratic Extraction)

Each summary must answer these questions:
1. **Core Concept**: If students remember ONE thing, what must it be?
2. **Key Mental Models**: What frameworks do they now see problems through?
3. **Critical Patterns**: What can they now DO that they couldn't before?
4. **Common Mistakes**: Where do students typically go wrong?

## Template
```markdown
### Core Concept
[1-2 sentences]

### Key Mental Models
- **[Model Name]**: [Explanation]
- **[Model Name]**: [Explanation]

### Critical Patterns
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]
- [Pattern 3]

### Common Mistakes
- [Mistake 1]
- [Mistake 2]
```

## Length Guidelines
- B2-C1 proficiency: 250-400 words per summary (more advanced concepts)
- Target: Concise, scannable, no full explanations

## Reference Lessons
Read each lesson file from /mnt/g/voice_learning/book_project/apps/learn-app/docs/02-Applied-General-Agent-Workflows/10-linux-mastery/

## Return Format
Return confirmation only (~50 lines max), NOT full content. List all 4 summary file paths with confirmation.
