You are rewriting Chapter 4 Lesson 2 to be MUCH shorter and more practical.

## Current Problem

Lesson 2 is 858 lines - WAY too long. It contains:
- ML theory (n-squared, RoPE) - ALREADY REMOVED but still verbose
- Multiple ASCII diagrams 
- Four Types of Context Rot (should move to Lesson 7)
- Three-Zone Strategy (should move to Lesson 3)
- 150-200 instruction limit (should move to Lesson 3)
- Overly verbose examples

## Anthropic's Approach

From "Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents":
- **Compaction:** "Summarize conversation history and reinitiate with compressed context"
- Simple, practical techniques - not theory
- Focus on what to DO, not why it works at the ML level

## Requirements for New Lesson 2

**Title:** "Managing Your Context Budget"

**Target length:** 250-300 lines (CUT from 858!)

**Structure:**
1. Opening: Your context fills up. Here's how to manage it. (2 paragraphs max)
2. The 70% threshold - ONE sentence explaining the fact, no theory
3. Zone System table (Green/Yellow/Orange/Red/Black) - KEEP, it's practical
4. Two Commands section (already added - keep it):
   - `/compact` - summarize and continue
   - `/clear` - reset and start fresh
5. Simple decision framework: "Task done? Clear. Task ongoing? Compact."
6. Brief "/context" monitoring example with real output
7. Lab: Work for 20 min, monitor context, practice compaction
8. 2-3 "Try With AI" prompts

**What to CUT/MOVE:**
- ❌ The U-Shaped Attention Curve section (keep ONE brief mention, no ASCII art)
- ❌ "Why Does This Happen?" section - professionals don't need to know WHY
- ❌ The 150-200 Instruction Limit → move to Lesson 3
- ❌ Four Types of Context Rot → move to Lesson 7
- ❌ Three-Zone Strategy → move to Lesson 3 (it's about CLAUDE.md structure)
- ❌ Verbose domain examples (Legal, Marketing, etc.) - cut most of them
- ❌ Multiple ASCII diagrams - keep at most ONE simple one

**Tone:** Brief, practical, action-oriented. "Here's what to do" not "Here's why it works."
