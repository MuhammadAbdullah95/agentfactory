Explore the learn-app codebase to understand:
1. How Summary and Personalisation tabs currently work - find the components
2. The overall architecture of the learn-app (Docusaurus config, custom components)
3. Any existing translation or i18n setup
4. How content is fetched and rendered on doc pages

Focus on:
- apps/learn-app/src/components/ (especially anything related to tabs, summaries, personalisation)
- apps/learn-app/docusaurus.config.ts
- Any API integrations or backend calls

Thoroughness: very thorough
