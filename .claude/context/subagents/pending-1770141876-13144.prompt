**DEEP STUDY: Subagent Coordination Patterns**

Study Chapter 3 lesson 9 and the actual agents implementation:

**1. Subagent Architecture**
- Read `apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/03-general-agents/09-subagents-and-orchestration.md`
- How do subagents get spawned?
- What's context isolation?

**2. Current Agents Implementation**
- List all agents in `.claude/agents/*.md`
- What's the YAML structure?
- How do tools get assigned?
- How do skills get assigned to agents?

**3. Agent ↔ Skill Relationship**
- Can agents invoke skills?
- How does skill assignment work in agent YAML?
- What's the invocation flow?

**4. Parallel vs Sequential**
- When to run agents in parallel?
- How to coordinate results?
- How to handle dependencies?

**5. Tool Access Patterns**
- What tools should content agents have?
- What tools should validation agents have?
- Current gaps (agents without tools)?

**6. Book Author Plugin Agents**
- What agents does our plugin need?
- How should they coordinate?
- What's the orchestration pattern?

Output concrete findings about subagent coordination and recommendations for our plugin.
