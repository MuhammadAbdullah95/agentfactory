Write Lesson 1: The CLI Architect Mindset

**CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES**:
- Output file: /mnt/g/voice_learning/book_project/apps/learn-app/docs/02-Applied-General-Agent-Workflows/10-linux-mastery/01-cli-architect-mindset.md
- Execute autonomously - DO NOT ask "Should I proceed?"
- DO NOT create new directories - use the path exactly as specified
- Write the file directly after gathering context

**Content Requirements**:
- Full YAML frontmatter (skills, learning_objectives, cognitive_load, differentiation)
- Chapter: 10, Lesson: 1, sidebar_position: 1
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Stage: 1 (Manual Foundation - NO AI assistance)
- New concepts: 5 (Terminal vs shell, Linux filesystem structure, absolute vs relative paths, basic navigation, CLI architect mindset)
- Proficiency: B1 (Intermediate)
- 3 "Try With AI" prompts with "What you're learning" explanations (but NO AI assistance in lesson content - Layer 1 requirement)
- Safety note at end
- All facts verified (no hallucinated statistics)

**Constitutional Requirements**:
- Every code block MUST have **Output:** section
- End with "## Try With AI" (no summary after)
- NO framework labels ("AI as Teacher", "Part 2:", etc.)

**Target Audience Context**:
- Students know: Basic computer literacy, what AI agents are (from Chapter 11), basic Git CLI (from Chapter 9)
- Students DON'T know: Linux filesystem structure, terminal vs shell distinction, why CLI matters for agents
- Explain from scratch: /, /home, /etc, /var, /usr directories; shell vs terminal; absolute vs relative paths; basic ls, cd, pwd commands

**Agent Scenario**: Digital FTEs live on servers at /var/agents, configs at /etc/agents - use this context throughout

**Reference Lesson for Quality**:
Match voice, level, and format of: /mnt/g/voice_learning/book_project/apps/learn-app/docs/02-Applied-General-Agent-Workflows/10-version-control/01-your-first-git-repository.md
