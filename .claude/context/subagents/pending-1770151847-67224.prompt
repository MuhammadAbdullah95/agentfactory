Explore the TeachMePanel component to understand:

1. Read `apps/learn-app/src/components/TeachMePanel/index.tsx` - understand the full component structure
2. How does the panel currently handle different modes (Teach vs Ask)?
3. What triggers open the panel currently?
4. What props does it accept?
5. How is state managed (open/closed, mode selection)?

Focus on understanding the mode switching mechanism and what would need to change to add an "Ask Mode" button.
