Validate the lesson file at /mnt/g/voice_learning/book_project/apps/learn-app/docs/02-Applied-General-Agent-Workflows/10-linux-mastery/04-bash-scripting-agent-automation.md against educational content requirements.

Read the file from disk and validate:
1. Complete YAML frontmatter (skills, learning_objectives, cognitive_load, differentiation)
2. Framework invisibility (no meta-commentary like "AI as Teacher" or "Part 2:")
3. Evidence presence (code blocks with Output sections)
4. Structural compliance (ends with "Try With AI" ONLY, no summary)
5. Proficiency metadata (uses proficiency_level, not deprecated cefr_level)
6. MDX safety (no angle brackets before letters/numbers that would break MDX)

Report validation results with PASS/FAIL status.
