FACTS TO VERIFY:

1. **SQLAlchemy ORM Patterns**
   - Models defined with declarative_base() (correct syntax?)
   - Column types: Integer, String, Float, DateTime, Date, Boolean (correct SQLAlchemy names?)
   - ForeignKey syntax: ForeignKey('table.column') (correct?)
   - relationship() and back_populates usage (correct SQLAlchemy 2.0+ pattern?)
   - Session context manager: with Session(engine) (correct?)
   - session.commit() and session.rollback() (correct semantics?)
   - QueuePool configuration: pool_size, max_overflow, pool_recycle, pool_pre_ping (correct parameters?)

2. **PostgreSQL / Neon Concepts**
   - Neon is serverless PostgreSQL (accurate?)
   - Neon free tier exists and is free (accurate?)
   - Connection string format: postgresql+psycopg2://... (correct?)
   - Neon requires SSL (sslmode=require) (accurate?)
   - Neon auto-pauses when idle (accurate?)
   - Neon supports branching (accurate?)
   - Default connection limit ~20 (accurate for Neon?)
   - pool_recycle=3600 is recommended for Neon (accurate?)

3. **Database Concepts**
   - Foreign keys prevent orphaned data (accurate?)
   - Transactions provide atomicity (accurate?)
   - Cascade delete options (cascade="all, delete-orphan" correct?)
   - Lazy loading vs eager loading behavior (accurate descriptions?)
   - Savepoints enable nested transactions (accurate?)
   - JOIN syntax in SQLAlchemy (correct patterns shown?)

4. **Python Version Requirements**
   - Python 3.9+ mentioned (appropriate?)
   - psycopg2-binary installation instructions (correct?)
   - python-dotenv for .env files (correct approach?)
   - datetime.utcnow deprecation mentioned (accurate for 3.12+?)

5. **Code Examples**
   - All code examples are syntactically valid SQLAlchemy 2.0+
   - No deprecated methods or patterns
   - All imports are correct
   - All database operations match shown Output blocks

VERIFICATION METHOD:
- Search official SQLAlchemy 2.0+ documentation
- Search official Neon documentation
- WebSearch for current best practices
- Verify all code examples could actually run

FACTUAL VERIFICATION REPORT - Chapter 08a
==========================================

Total Facts Verified: X
✅ VERIFIED: X facts (correct per official sources)
⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION: X facts (incomplete or ambiguous)
❌ INCORRECT: X facts (contradicts official sources)

Verified Facts:
- [Fact]: [Source] ✅
- [Fact]: [Source] ✅

Issues Found (if any):
- [Fact]: [What's wrong] [Official source says] → Fix: [Recommendation]

Severity Classification:
- CRITICAL: Code won't run, dangerous advice
- MAJOR: Misleading but fixable
- MINOR: Incomplete explanation, typos

Verdict: [PASS - no critical issues / FAIL - critical issues found]
```

Be systematic. Verify everything.
