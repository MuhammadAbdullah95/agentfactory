### Output Path
`/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/02-Applied-General-Agent-Workflows/11-meet-your-first-ai-employee/12-employees-senses.md`

### Context
OPTIONAL ADVANCED lesson. Introduces watchers - making the AI Employee proactive instead of reactive. Students configure Gmail and File watchers.

### Required Sections

1. **Narrative Opening**
   - "Your employee responds when asked. What if it noticed things first?"
   - Reactive vs proactive agents

2. **What Are Watchers?**
   - Background processes that monitor for events
   - Trigger agent actions when conditions met
   - "Eyes and ears" for your AI Employee

3. **Gmail Watcher**
   
   ```json5
   {
     watchers: {
       gmail: {
         enabled: true,
         pollIntervalMs: 60000,  // Check every minute
         triggers: [
           {
             name: "urgent-from-boss",
             from: "boss@company.com",
             action: "notify"
           },
           {
             name: "client-emails",
             from: "*@client.com",
             action: "summarize"
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **File Watcher**
   
   ```json5
   {
     watchers: {
       file: {
         enabled: true,
         paths: ["~/Downloads", "~/Documents/inbox"],
         patterns: ["*.pdf", "*.docx"],
         action: "analyze"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Notification Flow**
   ```
   Gmail Watcher detects new email
        │
        ▼
   Matches trigger rule?
        │
        ├── No → Ignore
        └── Yes → Execute action
                    │
                    ▼
             Send Telegram notification
   ```

6. **Configuring Watchers**
   ```bash
   openclaw config set watchers.gmail.enabled true
   openclaw config set watchers.gmail.pollIntervalMs 60000
   ```

7. **Testing Watchers**
   - Enable Gmail watcher
   - Send yourself a test email
   - Wait for notification on Telegram

8. **Safety Considerations**
   - Start with "notify" action only
   - Don't auto-respond without HITL (next lesson)
   - Rate limit to avoid spam

### Try With AI Prompts
```
1. "What watchers are currently configured? Are any active?"

2. "Set up a watcher to notify me when I get emails from important-client@company.com"

3. "I want to be notified about any new PDF files in my Downloads folder. How would I configure that?"
```
