### Context
OPTIONAL ADVANCED lesson on Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approval workflows. Students configure approval requirements for sensitive operations.

### Key Content Sources
1. `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/workspace/openclaw-main/docs/tools/exec-approvals.md` - Approval system

### Required Sections

1. **Narrative Opening**
   - "Your AI Employee can do a lot. Should it do everything automatically?"
   - The trust gradient

2. **The Trust Spectrum**
   ```
   Full Manual ──────────────────────── Full Autonomous
        │                                      │
   Every action                          No approvals
   requires approval                     (dangerous!)
        │
        └── HITL sits here: Trust common actions,
            verify sensitive ones
   ```

3. **Approval Modes**
   | Mode | Behavior | Use When |
   |------|----------|----------|
   | `off` | No approvals | Testing only |
   | `elevated` | Approve sensitive only | Production |
   | `always` | Approve everything | High-security |

4. **Configuring Approvals**
   
   ```json5
   {
     tools: {
       exec: {
         mode: "elevated",
         safeBins: ["ls", "cat", "pwd", "echo"],
         // These don't need approval
       }
     },
     
     // Per-tool configuration
     gmail: {
       approval: {
         send: "always",    // Always approve sends
         read: "off",       // Never approve reads
         delete: "always"   // Always approve deletes
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **The Approval Flow**
   ```
   Agent wants to send email
        │
        ▼
   Approval required?
        │
        ├── No → Execute immediately
        └── Yes → Send approval request
                       │
                       ▼
              You receive on Telegram:
              "Approve? Reply /approve or /deny"
                       │
                       ▼
              /approve 5MIN → Execute
              /deny → Cancel and notify agent
   ```

6. **Approval Commands**
   - `/approve` - Approve pending action
   - `/deny` - Reject pending action
   - `/pending` - List pending approvals

7. **Best Practices**
   - Start strict, relax as trust builds
   - Always require approval for: send, delete, financial
   - Never require approval for: read, search, summarize
   - Set timeout (5 min default) to avoid stale approvals

8. **Audit Logging**
   - All approvals logged
   - Who approved, when, what action
   - Review weekly for patterns

### Try With AI Prompts
```
1. "What approval settings are currently configured? What requires my approval?"

2. "I want sending emails to always require my approval, but reading should be automatic. Configure this."

3. "Show me the approval history. What have I approved recently?"
```
