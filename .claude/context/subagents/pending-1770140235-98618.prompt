**DEEP AUDIT: Chapter 3 Claude Code as Manager vs Current Implementation**

You are auditing whether we use Claude Code the way Chapter 3 teaches - especially the Boris Cherny "Creator Workflow" lesson.

**Read these files:**
1. Chapter 3 lessons: `apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/03-general-agents/` - Focus on:
   - `16-creator-workflow.md` (Boris Cherny best practices)
   - `07-concept-behind-skills.md`
   - `08-agent-skills.md`
   - `09-subagents-and-orchestration.md`
   - `15-ralph-wiggum-loop.md`

2. Current skills: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/.claude/skills/` - list and sample several
3. Current agents: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/.claude/agents/` - list and sample several
4. Log data: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/.claude/logs/mjunaidca/main/2026-02-03/skills.jsonl`

**Analyze:**

1. **Boris Cherny Creator Workflow**
   - What workflow does the lesson teach?
   - Are we using Claude Code this way?
   - What patterns should we adopt?

2. **Skill Architecture Reality Check**
   - Chapter 3 teaches skills should be simple folders
   - Our skills are 500-1000+ lines - is this aligned?
   - Should skills be smaller and more focused?

3. **Subagent Usage**
   - Chapter 3 teaches when to use subagents vs skills
   - Log data shows 24:1 subagent:skill ratio - is this correct?
   - Are we over-engineering with subagents?

4. **Ralph Wiggum Loop**
   - What is this pattern?
   - Are we using it?
   - Should our content generation use self-correcting loops?

5. **Skills We Should Have vs Skills We Have**
   - Based on Chapter 3's teaching, what skills should exist?
   - What do we have that we don't need?
   - What's missing?
