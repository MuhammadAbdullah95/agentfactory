Analyze what Chapters 3, 4, and 5 TEACH students to build. Extract:

1. **Skills taught** (Ch 3 L7-8): What skill patterns are students supposed to create?
2. **Subagent patterns taught** (Ch 3 L9): What subagent orchestration is taught?
3. **Context engineering taught** (Ch 4): What context management patterns?
4. **SDD workflow taught** (Ch 5): What spec-driven workflow?

For each, extract the CONCRETE patterns students should implement.

Chapter paths:
- Ch 3: apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/03-general-agents/
- Ch 4: apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/04-context-engineering/
- Ch 5: apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/05-spec-driven-development/

Focus on ACTIONABLE patterns, not theory.
