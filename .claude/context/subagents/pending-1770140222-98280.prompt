**DEEP AUDIT: Chapter 1 Vision vs Current CLAUDE.md & Constitution**

You are auditing whether the Agent Maturity Model and Digital FTE vision from Chapter 1 is properly encoded in our governance documents.

**Read these files:**
1. Chapter 1 lessons: `apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/01-agent-factory-paradigm/` - ALL lessons
2. Current CLAUDE.md: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/CLAUDE.md`
3. Constitution: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/test/.specify/memory/constitution.md`

**Analyze:**

1. **Agent Maturity Model**
   - What maturity levels does Chapter 1 define?
   - Is this encoded in CLAUDE.md or constitution?
   - Should agents self-assess their maturity?

2. **Digital FTE Vision**
   - What is the core thesis Chapter 1 teaches?
   - Is CLAUDE.md aligned with "building sellable Digital FTEs"?
   - Does the current system produce Digital FTEs or just content?

3. **Seven Principles**
   - What are the 7 principles from Chapter 1?
   - Are they in CLAUDE.md?
   - Are they actively enforced or just documented?

4. **What Should Be in CLAUDE.md**
   - Based on Chapter 1's vision, what MUST be in CLAUDE.md?
   - What's currently there that shouldn't be?
   - What's missing?

5. **SpecKit Plus Assessment**
   - Does Chapter 1's vision require custom SDD tooling?
   - Or does Claude Code native (Tasks, Plan Mode) suffice?
