Research Claude Code's PreToolUse hook system thoroughly. I need to verify claims made in an educational lesson about memory injection.

The lesson (Lesson 8: Memory Injection) claims:
1. PreToolUse fires "before each tool execution" 
2. You can access AI's "thinking blocks" from the transcript
3. You can inject content via "additionalContext"
4. It's synchronous and must complete quickly (<500ms recommended)

I need you to verify:

1. **Hook signature**: What parameters does PreToolUse receive? What can it return?

2. **Thinking block access**: Can hooks actually access Claude's thinking/reasoning? How?

3. **additionalContext injection**: Does this field exist? How does it work?

4. **Timing constraints**: Are there documented performance requirements?

5. **Practical examples**: Find real implementations of PreToolUse hooks

Search for:
- Official Claude Code documentation on hooks
- GitHub examples of PreToolUse hooks
- The hook system architecture
- Any limitations or gotchas

Return a verification report comparing the lesson's claims against documented reality.
