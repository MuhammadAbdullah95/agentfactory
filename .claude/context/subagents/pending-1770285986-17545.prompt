Analyze the current Part 2 structure at `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorsgpt/agentfactory/apps/learn-app/docs/02-Applied-General-Agent-Workflows/`

**Questions:**
1. What chapters exist? What's the current structure?
2. What workflows are currently covered?
3. Is there a pattern of "one workflow per chapter"?
4. How does Chapter 11 (Build Your AI Employee) fit as capstone?
5. What's missing if we wanted workflow-specific chapters?

List all chapters with their lesson counts and main focus.

Be thorough - we need the full picture of Part 2 as it exists today.
