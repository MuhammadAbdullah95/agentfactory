Audit the current .claude/ implementation. Analyze:

1. **Skills in .claude/skills/**: List all skills, their purpose, and usage patterns
2. **Agents in .claude/agents/**: List all agents, their tools, their relationships
3. **Commands in .claude/commands/**: List all sp.* commands
4. **Hooks**: Any hooks configured?

For each skill/agent, determine:
- Is it actively used? (check logs at .claude/logs/mjunaidca/main/2026-02-03/)
- Does it follow the patterns taught in Ch 3-5?
- Is there duplication or bloat?

Output a structured inventory with usage assessment.
